## Akshay's Tomb

Akshay's Tomb is a work of fiction produced in accordance with the latest Freehull terms and conditions (_rev. 1512-02-15_). The appropriate writing and dissemination licenses have been obtained and are on file at the Freehull Estate Administration Center.

As contractually stipulated, work is being done in an open environment to ensure adherance to previously negotiated timelines. The author (David Todd) acknowledges that failure to abide by timeline will result in a summons, to be determined at a later date, of a type that does not preclude supernatural origin.

## Citizens Success Committee Public Archives

As the only actively maintained repository in the land of Freehull, the Issues are operated in partnership with the Citizens Success Commitee in order to promote transparency and empower the Freehull community to collaborate on local issues.

If you are not trained in the way of the byte, you may also submit issues in person or via carrier pigeon to:

```
David Todd
Citizens Success Committee
Department of the People, Freehull
```

I will do my best to publish them in a timely fashion.
