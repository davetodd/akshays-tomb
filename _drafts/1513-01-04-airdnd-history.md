## Overview

AirDnD is a popular service for connecting dungeons to aspiring adventures. In exchange for unidentified loot, the company lists dungeon events, quests, and rentals.

Tornald Goldencleave founded AirDnD after observing the failure of traditional marketing strategies to expose dungeons to the adventurers best suited for them. Similar misalignments existed in the dungeon rental market. 

The first part of this analysis will discuss the historical factors behind these inefficiencies, which ultimately led AirDnD to provide the matchmaking service that it does today. The second part will detail the founding of AirDnD, and the third will cover the company's current operations and economic impact.

## The illusion of the dungeon as a closed economy

In popular mythos, dungeons, strongholds, and other lairs are often completely isolated, visited only occasionally by an intrepid party of adventurers. In reality, very few dungeons can function for centuries as closed economies. Employees must be recruited from above (or below) to provide everything from security to janitorial services.

### Ensuring a constant food supply

Dungeons must acquire an ongoing food supply from the surrounding region. Exceptions to this are usually short in duration or small in scale; there may be enough stockpiled to weather a brief siege, but it is almost impossible to be permanently self sufficient. Mushroom cultivation tends to be small scale. Hydroponics require a constant infusion of light spells. 

<div class="case-study">
<p>The longest known account of total self-sufficiency belongs to two druidic dungeons built into the cliffs on the opposite side of the Thoan Valley. An earthquake buried the entrance to each dungeon, and nothing was heard from the occupants for almost three centuries. The dungeons were rediscovered by a dwarven prospecting team, who sold their claim to a wandering archaeologist.</p>

<p>Journals suggest that the occupants survived for two centuries on the  harvest of their Plant Growth spells. However, it appears that each dungeon blamed the other for the original earthquake. With remarkable simultaneity, they infiltrated each other's dungeon with spells of Passwall and unleashed insect swarms on the opposing subterranean gardens. Both sides apparently succumbed to starvation.</p>

If your staff can subsist on the dead, then proximity to a cemetery is a boon, as long as the bodies last. Ongoing (and fresher) arrangements can sometimes be made with mortuaries. Other dungeons require access to an above ground food source, either directly or indirectly via the markets. 

### Access to specialists

Flaws in structural engineering can do more damage to a dungeon than a mid-level adventuring party. Cave-ins are one manifestation: entire rooms, halls, and floors can be lost, becoming accessible only via teleportation. Collapsing frames can spring traps and open cages; before a dungeon lord knows it, her entire housekeeping staff might be slaughtered by dream sheep. 

Identifying and resolving these problems require specialists with more skills than would fit in the typical adventurer's compendium.

Structural, chemical, and device engineers are needed; these and others make up the specialist network.

Training needs to be provided for the creatures. (Because we can't just rely on PluralSight.)

How do dungeons get in touch with the relevant specialists? Some maintain contacts in the local town. Some specialists travel, effectively doing their own questing.

## Organic reputation growth

Many dungeons provide opportunities for riches, valor, or common recreational violence. Some cater to particular niches, serving archaeologists, heliophobes, amateur necromancers, and others. A few dungeons operate formal holding cells in accordance with state contracts; these compete for access to notable prisoners in order to appeal to the lucrative prison rescue demographic.

Dungeons typically rely on word of mouth to grow their reputation. One might assume that the specialist network would be one method for doing so, but actually, most specialists operate under strict non-disclosures. It does no good for a dungeon to attract an adventure who has spoken to the dwarf responsible for its annual trap maintenance.

It can take centuries for a well-hidden dungeon to become a marketable destination. During this time, the dungeon must be kept in a constant state of readiness for the unlikely visitor[^1]. Adventurers are unlikely to review and recommend a vacated property unless loot is left behind, but that obviously exposes the dungeon lord to the risk of significant property loss.

Over a long enough timescale, organic marketing can also lead to inaccurate dungeon listings. These listings, often compiled from tavern gossip reports, frequently mislead the aspiring adventure. A historian in search of the crypt of a famous wandering minstrel is unlikely to be thrilled by an exhibit celebrating the phylactery of a minor lich king.

A negative review from a misled adventure can compound the problem a dungeon faces in managing its reputation growth. Preconceived biases can lead to misunderstandings, and these misunderstandings often result in subjective and inaccurate reviews. A beneficent lich king may be accused of untoward interest in a party’s souls; in reality, he or she might actually be open to sponsoring quests to procure the souls of corrupt state officials.

## Outbound marketing strategies

Traditionally, dungeons have used murder, theft, and abduction to expedite their outreach. While each technique has its own unique challenges, they all share common difficulties, particularly in hiring and execution.

The job requirements for outbound marketing campaigns can be hard to fill. In order to be effective, a campaign must be traceable back to its originating dungeon. This creates unique constraints. For example, a team of half-orcs must be skilled enough to execute the following:

1. Enter a town and identify either a wealthy or well-loved citizen
1. Kill the citizen and any bodyguards in front of witnesses
1. Lead witnesses back to the dungeon

The third step is crucial. Even a botched murder attempt can invite recrimination, but all is for nought if the perpetrators cannot be found. A successful marketing campaign must achieve its operational goal without incapacitating all possible pursuit. In addition, the half-orcs must return to the dungeon safely, or else there will be no reason to embark on a quest to avenge the victim. Besides, it is exceedingly hard to recruit for suicide missions without involving the cults[^2].

Without property targeting, even well executed plans can fail to drive customer acquisition. Dungeons often fail to remember that the target of a campaign should not be a victim of it. If a shape-shifting halfling rogue is hired to steal a wand of polymorph from the local warlock, it is imperative that the warlock not be the one to retrieve the wand from the dungeon. Typically, victims who are competent enough to recover their own stolen gear are too embarrassed by the initial theft to widely publicize it. Better to murder the warlock in front of an impressionable apprentice who can devote years to the quest of retrieving the wand.

Effective targeting requires significant market research and due diligence. Abductions are no exception. When abducting the child of a wealthy family, it is best not to demand a ransom. Let the prospective rescuers believe that they will earn a reward from the family. Abducting a child from an impoverished family is usually ineffective, unless it is well publicized in the lawful good community.

## Ownership and rental considerations

Suppose a party of adventurers pursues a band of half-orcs back to their dungeon. In the best case, waiting kobold guards will slaughter the party, excepting the bard, who should be maimed and released. Later, the bard’s tales may inspire a visit from an uncommonly high level party, or perhaps the kobolds will unionize and fail to respond to an incursion that requires overtime. Whatever the cause, even the most [nefarious] dungeons may eventually be cleared.

Fortunately for the dungeon lord, it is unlikely that the victorious adventurers will be interested in the property itself. Staff may be decimated, traps vandalized, and loot stolen, but the dungeon lord still owns the dungeon. If a contingency plan is followed and a dark shadow is seen disappearing into depths, the dungeon may actually see an upsurge in rumors and speculation.

Regardless of the public relations impact, a dungeon lord needs to consider what to do next. Rebuild, sell, or rent? Rebuilding is expensive: staff must be hired and re-corrupted. New traps must be designed and implemented; anything more complicated than a common snake pit[^3] can require consultations with specialists whose backlogs can be years long.

A dungeon [clearing] is thus a common impetus for selling a property, and the sale may not always be voluntary. Investors and rivals can be equally coercive. Investors may feel that the property can be better managed by, for example, a dungeon lord with rats of unusual size. 

Rivals may pursue a hostile takeover for a variety of reasons: diversification, increased economy of scale, or simply an opportunity to stick it to a dungeon lord with a different alignment. In fact, rivals are often responsible for instigating the dungeon clear

The third option is to lease the property. An owner of an abandoned mine may want to rent it out for several years as a bandit camp. Cults are often interested in short term leases (especially suicide cults with an impending drop dead date). Renting event space is also viable, perhaps as a temporary location for holding a kidnapped victim.

Promoting a rental property presents some of the same marketing problems, except that the outbound strategies used to market to adventurers are wholly ineffective. No corrupt mercenary wants his or her own loot stolen by the dungeon lord. Rentees often seek references, and a murdered former tenant is as useless in this regard as en evicted one (although at least a murdered tenant cannot seek revenge.)

## Conclusion

[...]

[^1]: Pressure to reduce expenditures on staffing and maintenance may explain why ruin and decay are common motifs in the industry. 
[^2]: Due to the unique complexities of managing that relationship, most dungeon lords prefer to avoid cults altogether. Typically, a cult will operate its own dungeon with a minimum of external partnerships.
[^3]: Even snake pits can be expensive if the snakes need to be imported or bewitched.
