## Overview

AirDnD is a popular service for connecting dungeons to aspiring adventures. In exchange for unidentified loot, the company lists dungeon events, quests, and rentals.

Tornald Goldencleave founded AirDnD after observing the failure of traditional marketing strategies to expose dungeons to the adventurers best suited for them. Similar misalignments existed in the dungeon rental market. The first part of this analysis will discuss the historical factors behind these inefficiencies. Future parts will cover the founding of AirDnD, its current operations, and its economic impact.

## The illusion of the dungeon as a closed economy

In popular mythos, dungeons, strongholds, and other lairs are often completely isolated, visited only by intrepid parties of adventurers. In reality, very few dungeons can function for centuries as closed economies. Employees must be recruited from above (or below) to provide everything from security to janitorial services.

### Ensuring a constant food supply

Dungeons must acquire an ongoing food supply from the surrounding region. Exceptions to this are usually short in duration or small in scale. Food may be stockpiled to withstand brief sieges, but it is almost impossible to be permanently self sufficient. Actual in-dungeon production is either expensive (hydroponics requires a constant source of light emitting spells) or calorically inefficient (mushroom cultivation).

If a dungeon's staff can subsist on the dead, then proximity to a cemetery is a boon, as long as the bodies last. Ongoing (and fresher) arrangements can sometimes be made with mortuaries. However, most dungeons require either access to markets, farms, fisheries, or hunting grounds.

The need for food naturally creates relationships between the inhabitants of a dungeons and its surroundings. Rarely are these relationships antagonistic: a dungeon that treats local homesteads as fodder for its cannibalistic ceremonies will soon attract eager adventurers. This can be effective marketing, but it is not sustainable eating. Usually, dungeon lords will negotiate with members of the local food industry on behalf of themselves or their tenants. Does the butcher close early on Fridays? Maybe the curtains are drawn so that the dungeon's hobgoblin kitchen manager can supervise the weekly requisition without troubling the townsfolk.

### Access to specialists

Flaws in structural engineering can do more damage to a dungeon than a mid-level adventuring party. Cave-ins are one manifestation: entire rooms, halls, and floors can be lost, becoming accessible only via teleportation. Collapsing tunnels can spring traps and open cages; before a dungeon lord knows it, her entire housekeeping staff could be slaughtered by dream sheep. 

Maintaining a dungeon requires specialists with more skills than there is space in the typical adventurer's compendium. Sometimes, particularly with goblin infestations or tenants who have overstayed their lease, it is possible to manufacture a quest to resolve the issue. But this can have unpredictable results, and it is subject to various shortcomings in marketing to the adventuring community.

Instead, it may be desirable to hire a professional. A chemical engineer may be called in to repair a leaking acid line. A licensed enchanter may be needed to recalibrate a misfiring teleportation circle. There are dwarven master craftsmen who handle nothing but pressure plates. Disassembling a previous tenant's traps is a common nuisance for the dungeon lord and is one of the reasons that security deposits are so large.

Dungeon staff also have training and personal development needs. Companies such as SingularVision produce Silent Image spellbooks that can simulate intrusions and other calamities, but these are expensive and the content is often out of date. Staff can be sent to conferences, but there is a risk that watching sentries will mistake the intent of a lanyard wearing bugbear and sound an unwanted alarm. On-site training is another possibility; that beggar whom everyone knows to be a high level wizard may also moonlight as a corporate instructor.

Some specialists are migratory, regularly travelling between their preferred dungeons or questing for new business. Others operate legitimate businesses and simply choose not to publicize their dungeon work, most of which is performed with strict non-disclosure agreements. A dungeon has no interest in attracting an adventurer who has spoken to the dwarf responsible for its annual trap maintenance.

## Organic reputation growth

The mundane business of day to day operations is a challenge that all dungeon marketing has to overcome. Adventurers are usually uninterested in the logistics of dungeon sanitation, and they prefer not to know that there are annual performance reviews for the wights who threaten them in the catacombs. As a result, dungeons typically do not use the professional specialist network for promotion, relying instead on organic reputation growth.

It can take centuries for a well-hidden dungeon to become a marketable destination. Nevertheless, the dungeon must be kept in a constant state of readiness for the unlikely visitor[^1]. Adventurers are unlikely to review and recommend a vacated property unless loot is left behind, but that obviously exposes the dungeon lord to the risk of significant property loss.

Many dungeons provide opportunities for riches, valor, or common recreational violence. Some cater to particular niches, serving archaeologists, heliophobes, amateur necromancers, and others. A few dungeons operate formal holding cells in accordance with state contracts; these compete for access to notable prisoners in order to lure the lucrative prison rescue demographic.

Over a long enough timescale, organic marketing can lead to inaccurate dungeon listings. These listings, often compiled from tavern gossip reports, frequently mislead the aspiring adventure. A historian in search of the crypt of a famous wandering minstrel is unlikely to be thrilled by an exhibit celebrating the phylactery of a minor lich king.

A negative review from a misled adventure can compound the problem a dungeon faces in managing its reputation growth. Preconceived biases can lead to misunderstandings, and these misunderstandings often result in subjective and inaccurate reviews. A beneficent lich queen may be accused of untoward interest in a party's souls; in reality, she might actually be hoping to sponsor a quest to procure the soul of a corrupt state official.

## Outbound marketing strategies

Traditionally, dungeons have used murder, theft, and abduction to expedite their outreach. While each technique has its own unique challenges, they all share common difficulties, particularly in hiring and execution.

The job requirements for outbound marketing campaigns can be hard to fill. In order to be effective, a campaign must be traceable back to its originating dungeon. For example, a team of half-orcs must be skilled enough to execute the following:

1. Enter a town and identify either a wealthy or well-loved citizen
1. Kill the citizen and any bodyguards in front of witnesses
1. Lead witnesses back to the dungeon

The third step is crucial. Even a botched murder attempt can invite recrimination, but all is for nought if the perpetrators cannot be found. A successful marketing campaign must achieve its operational goal without incapacitating all possible pursuit. In addition, the half-orcs must return to the dungeon safely, or else there will be no reason to embark on a quest to avenge the victim. Besides, it is exceedingly hard to recruit for suicide missions without involving the cults[^2].

Without property targeting, even well executed plans can fail to drive customer acquisition. Dungeons often fail to remember that the victim of a campaign should not be its target. If a shape-shifting halfling rogue is hired to steal the wand of polymorph from the local warlock, it is imperative that the warlock not be the one to retrieve the wand from the dungeon. Typically, victims who are competent enough to recover their own stolen gear are too embarrassed by the initial theft to widely publicize it. Better to murder the warlock in front of an impressionable apprentice who can devote years to the quest of retrieving the wand.

Effective targeting requires significant market research and due diligence. Abductions are no exception. When abducting the child of a wealthy family, it is best not to demand a ransom. Let the prospective rescuers believe that they will earn a reward from the family. Abducting a child from an impoverished family is usually ineffective, unless it is well publicized in the lawful good community.

## Ownership and rental considerations

Suppose a party of adventurers pursues a band of half-orcs back to their dungeon. In the best case, waiting kobold guards will slaughter the party, excepting the bard, who should be maimed and released. Later, the bardâ€™s tales may inspire a visit from an uncommonly high level party, or perhaps the kobolds will unionize and fail to respond to an incursion that requires overtime. Whatever the cause, even the most dastardly dungeons may eventually be cleared.

Fortunately for the dungeon lord, it is unlikely that the victorious adventurers will be interested in the property itself. Staff may be decimated, traps vandalized, and loot stolen, but the dungeon lord still owns the dungeon. If a contingency plan is followed and a dark shadow is seen disappearing into depths, the dungeon may actually see an upsurge in rumors and speculation.

Regardless of the public relations impact, a dungeon lord needs to consider what to do next. Rebuild, sell, or rent? Rebuilding is expensive: staff must be hired and re-corrupted. New traps must be designed and implemented; anything more complicated than a common snake pit[^3] can require consultations with specialists whose backlogs are years long.

A dungeon clearing is thus a common impetus for selling a property, and the sale may not always be voluntary. Investors and rivals can be equally coercive. Investors may feel that the property can be better managed by a dungeon lord with rats of unusual size. Rivals may pursue a hostile takeover for a variety of reasons: diversification, increased economies of scale, or simply an opportunity to stick it to a dungeon lord with a different alignment. In fact, rivals are often responsible for instigating the dungeon clear in the first place.

The third option is to lease the property. An owner of an abandoned mine may choose to rent it out for several years as a bandit camp. Cults are often interested in short term leases (especially suicide cults with an impending drop dead date). Renting event space is also viable, perhaps as a temporary holding site for a kidnapped victim.

Promoting a rental property presents some of the same marketing problems, except that the outbound strategies used to market to adventurers are wholly ineffective. No corrupt mercenary wants his or her own loot stolen by the dungeon lord. Rentees often seek references, and a murdered former tenant is as useless in this regard as an evicted one.

## Conclusion

Historically, adventurers have had little exposure to the dungeon industry. This may seem surprising, given all of the lore and mythology, but that is just the marketing. The adventuring party is usually unaware of the centuries of labor that have gone into decorating and defending a dungeon. The party probably has no idea that their quest was only an excuse to rid a dungeon lord of a troublesome tenant.

Contrary to the belief of many industry observers, this misperception was not a necessary condition. By providing a platform for dungeons to reach directly to their [participants], AirDnD [provided value...]. The next part in this series will discuss the origin of the company.
