## Overview

AirDnD is a popular service for connecting dungeons to aspiring adventures. The company provides a platform for booking dungeon events, quests, and rentals. It receives a commission on each booking and will accept unidentified loot as payment.

Tornald Goldencleave founded AirDnD after observing the inefficiency of traditional dungeon marketing strategies, which often fail to expose adventurers to the dungeons that best suit them. The first part of this analysis will discuss the historical factors behind this inefficiency. Future parts will cover the founding of AirDnD, its current operations, and its economic impact.

## The illusion of the dungeon as a closed economy

In popular mythos, dungeons, strongholds, and other lairs are often completely isolated, visited only by intrepid parties of adventurers. In reality, very few dungeons can function for centuries as closed economies. Maintenance is an ongoing concern; licensed specialists may be needed for repairs. Unless the dungeon has been retrofitted with an "abandoned" motif, employees must be recruited from above (or below) to provide everything from security to janitorial services. Permanent staff have dietary, spiritual, and other unique needs. For instance, the Union of Operating Golems requires that employers pay into a shared pension pool. 

Even the most substantial hoards can be destroyed by operational costs, so prudent owners are always looking for ways to replenish their holdings. Some owners rent space, both short and long term, in an attempt to offload cost (and risk of attack) on to their tenants. However, rental prices are closely correlated to a dungeon's security, so many owners are capped on what they can charge if they do not commit to the same levels of maintenance and protection that they would provide for themselves.

The consequence of this, if an owner wishes to avoid bankruptcy and foreclosure, is that a dungeon must attract adventurers. The gear of a vanquished adventurer can be a welcome addition to the hoard. A handful of bodies can lower monthly food expenditures. Captured souls can always be put to good use. 

All adventurers, including the mad ones, need an incentive to risk their gear and their lives. Some dungeon owners covertly publish the size of their hoards; others use criminal or occult behavior to create a moral incentive. Either way, the incentive must be promoted. AirDnD provides a centralized platform for this promotion, replacing the informal networks that dungeons used to rely on. 

When a dungeon tunnels under and collapses a nearby castle, it no longer needs to wait for an impulsive and ill-prepared rogue to overhear the drunken heir bemoaning the demise of his birthright in a seedy tavern. Instead, it can immediately list the sunken castle on AirDnD.

To better understand the disruptive nature of AirDnD, the next sections will provide additional background on dungeon logistics and the shortcomings of traditional marketing.

### Ensuring a constant food supply

Dungeons must acquire an ongoing food supply from the surrounding region. Exceptions to this are usually short in duration or small in scale. Food may be stockpiled to withstand brief sieges, but it is almost impossible to be permanently self sufficient. Actual in-dungeon production is either expensive (hydroponics requires a constant source of light emitting spells) or calorically inefficient (mushroom cultivation).

If a dungeon's staff can subsist on the dead, then proximity to a cemetery is a boon, as long as the bodies last. Ongoing (and fresher) arrangements can sometimes be made with mortuaries. However, most dungeons require either access to markets, farms, fisheries, or hunting grounds.

<div class="aside">
<div class="aside-header">Case Study</div>
<p>The longest known account of corporeal self sufficiency belongs to a pair of druidic dungeons on opposite sides of the Thoan Valley. An earthquake induced landslide buried their entrances, and nothing was heard from the occupants for almost three centuries.</p> 
  
<p>The dungeons were rediscovered by a dwarven prospecting team, who sold their claim to a wandering archaeologist. Journals suggest that the occupants survived for two centuries on the harvest of their Plant Growth spells. However, it appears that each dungeon blamed the other for the original earthquake. With remarkable simultaneity, they infiltrated each other's dungeon using spells of Passwall and unleashed insect swarms on the subterranean gardens. Both sides soon succumbed to starvation.</p>
</div>

The need for food naturally creates relationships between the inhabitants of a dungeons and its surroundings. Rarely are these relationships antagonistic: a dungeon that treats local homesteads as fodder for its cannibalistic ceremonies will soon attract eager adventurers. This can be effective marketing, but it is not sustainable nutrition. Usually, owners will negotiate with members of the local food industry on behalf of themselves or their tenants. Does the butcher close early on Fridays? Maybe the curtains are drawn so that the dungeon's hobgoblin kitchen manager can supervise the weekly requisition.

### Access to specialists

Flaws in structural engineering can do more damage to a dungeon than a mid-level adventuring party. Cave-ins are one manifestation: entire rooms, halls, and floors can be lost, becoming accessible only via teleportation. Collapsing tunnels can spring traps and open cages; before an owner knows it, her entire housekeeping staff could be slaughtered by dream sheep. 

Maintaining a dungeon requires specialists with more skills than there is space in the typical adventurer's compendium. Sometimes, particularly with goblin infestations or tenants who have overstayed their lease, it is possible to manufacture a quest to resolve the issue. But this can have unpredictable results because of the indiscriminate nature of marketing to the adventuring community.

Usually, it is best to hire a professional. A chemical engineer may be called in to repair a leaking acid line. A licensed enchanter may be needed to recalibrate a misfiring teleportation circle. There are dwarven master craftsmen who work exclusively with pressure plates. Disassembling a previous tenant's traps is a common nuisance for the owner and is one of the reasons that security deposits are so large.

Dungeon staff also have training and personal development needs. Companies such as SingularVision produce Silent Image spellbooks that can simulate intrusions and other calamities, but these are expensive and the content is often out of date. Staff can be sent to conferences, but there is a risk that watching sentries will mistake the intent of a lanyard wearing bugbear and sound an unwanted alarm. On-site training is another possibility; that beggar whom everyone knows to be a high level wizard may also moonlight as a dungeon instructor.

Some specialists are migratory, regularly travelling between dungeons and questing for new clients. Others operate legitimate businesses and simply choose not to publicize their dungeon work, most of which is performed under strict non-disclosure agreements. A dungeon has no interest in attracting an adventurer who has spoken to the dwarf responsible for its annual trap maintenance.

## Dungeon marketing

The mundane business of day to day operations is a challenge that all dungeon marketing has to overcome. Adventurers are usually uninterested in the logistics of dungeon sanitation, and they prefer not to know that there are annual performance reviews for the wights who threaten them in the catacombs. As a result, dungeons typically do not use the professional specialist network for promotion, relying instead on other means.

### Organic reputation growth

It can take centuries for a well-hidden dungeon to become a marketable destination. Nevertheless, the dungeon must be kept in a constant state of readiness for the unlikely visitor[^1]. Adventurers are unlikely to review and recommend a vacated property unless loot is left behind, but that obviously exposes the owner to the risk of significant property loss.

Many dungeons provide opportunities for riches, valor, or common recreational violence. Some cater to particular niches, serving archaeologists, heliophobes, amateur necromancers, and others. A few dungeons operate formal holding cells in accordance with state contracts; these compete for access to notable prisoners in order to lure the lucrative prison rescue demographic.

Over a long enough timescale, organic marketing can lead to inaccurate dungeon listings. These listings, often compiled from tavern gossip reports, frequently mislead the aspiring adventure. A historian in search of the crypt of a famous wandering minstrel is unlikely to be thrilled by an exhibit celebrating the phylactery of a minor lich king.

A negative review from a misled adventure can compound the problem a dungeon faces in managing its reputation growth. Preconceived biases can lead to misunderstandings, and these misunderstandings often result in subjective and inaccurate reviews. A beneficent lich queen may be accused of untoward interest in a party's souls; in reality, she might be hoping to sponsor a quest to procure the soul of a corrupt state official.

### Outbound strategies

Traditionally, dungeons have used murder, theft, and abduction to expedite their outreach. While each technique has its own unique challenges, they all share common difficulties, particularly in hiring and execution.

The job requirements for outbound marketing campaigns can be hard to fill. In order to be effective, a campaign must be traceable back to its originating dungeon. For example, a team of half-orcs must be skilled enough to execute the following:

1. Enter a town and identify either a wealthy or well-loved citizen
1. Kill the citizen and any bodyguards in front of witnesses
1. Lead witnesses back to the dungeon

The third step is crucial. Even a botched murder attempt can invite recrimination, but all is for nought if the perpetrators cannot be found. A successful marketing campaign must achieve its operational goal without incapacitating all possible pursuit. In addition, the half-orcs must return to the dungeon safely, or else there will be no reason to embark on a quest to avenge the victim. Besides, it is exceedingly hard to recruit for suicide missions without involving the cults[^2].

Without property targeting, even well executed plans can fail to drive customer acquisition. Dungeons often fail to remember that the victim of a campaign should not be its target. If a shape-shifting halfling rogue is hired to steal the wand of polymorph from the local warlock, it is imperative that the warlock not be the one to retrieve the wand from the dungeon. Typically, victims who are competent enough to recover their own stolen gear are too embarrassed by the initial theft to widely publicize it. Better to murder the warlock in front of an impressionable apprentice who can devote years to the quest of retrieving the wand.

Effective targeting requires significant market research and due diligence. Abductions are no exception. When abducting the child of a wealthy family, it is best not to demand a ransom. Let the prospective rescuers believe that they will earn a reward from the family. Abducting a child from an impoverished family is usually ineffective, unless it is well publicized in the lawful good community.

## Ownership and rental considerations

Suppose a party of adventurers pursues a band of half-orcs back to their dungeon. In the best case, waiting kobold guards will slaughter the party, excepting the bard, who should be maimed and released. Later, the bard’s tales may inspire a visit from an uncommonly high level party, or perhaps the kobolds will unionize and fail to respond to an incursion that requires overtime. Whatever the cause, even the most dastardly dungeons may eventually be cleared.

Fortunately for the owner, it is unlikely that the victorious adventurers will be interested in the property itself. Staff may be decimated, traps vandalized, and loot stolen, but the owner still has a dungeon. If a contingency plan is followed and a dark shadow is seen disappearing into depths, the dungeon may even see an upsurge in rumors and speculation.

Regardless of the public relations impact, an owner needs to consider what to do next. Rebuild, sell, or rent? Rebuilding is expensive: new staff must be hired and corrupted. New traps must be designed and implemented; anything more complicated than a common snake pit[^3] can require consultations with specialists whose backlogs are years long.

A dungeon clearing is thus a common impetus for selling a property, and the sale may not always be voluntary. Investors and rivals can be equally coercive. Investors may feel that the property can be better managed by an owner with more rats of unusual size. Rivals may pursue a hostile takeover for a variety of reasons: diversification, increased economies of scale, or simply an opportunity to stick it to an owner with a different alignment. In fact, rivals are often responsible for instigating the dungeon clear in the first place. 

<div class="aside">
<div class="aside-header">Case Study</div>
<p>Mord Awala was an early employee of AirDnD. Before joing the company, she ran a consultancy producing quests that targetted her clients' rival dungeons. Stakeholders in The Silvinium Group, a dungeon investing firm, contracted her to weaken the finances of a vampiric dungeon that had resisted their attempt to become minority partners.</p> 

<p>Awala promoted a rumor that a celestial treasure was locked inside of the dungeon in a box that could only be opened with direct sunlight. A team of paladins invaded with a set of enchanted mirrors, killed the vampires they encountered, but failed to find the treasure. The actual owner of the dungeon was an absentee kitsune. To avoid the hassle of finding a new tenant, he accepted a buyout offer from The Silvinium Group.</p>
</div>

The third option is to lease the property. An owner of an abandoned mine may choose to rent it out for several years as a bandit camp. Cults are often interested in short term leases (especially suicide cults with an impending drop dead date). Renting event space is also viable, perhaps as a holding site for a kidnapped victim or a reception hall for couples seeking a particular wedding ambience.

Promoting a rental property has some of the same issues as marketing to adventurers, except that the outbound strategies used to reach adventurers are wholly ineffective. No corrupt mercenary wants his or her own loot stolen by the owner. Rentees often seek references, and a murdered former tenant is as useless in this regard as an evicted one.

## Conclusion

Historically, adventurers have had little exposure to the dungeon industry. Despite (or perhap because of) the lore and mythology, an adventuring party is usually unaware of the centuries of labor that have gone into decorating and defending a dungeon. The party probably has no idea that their quest was only an excuse to rid an owner of a troublesome tenant.

Contrary to the belief of many industry observers, this misperception is not necessary to maintain a dungeon's appeal. A blind monk's riddle almost always fails to enumerate all of a dungeon's amenitites. By providing a platform for adventurers to book dungeons directly, AirDnD has eliminated much of this confusion[^4]. The next parts of this analysis will discuss the impact of that latform on the industry.

[^1]: Pressure to reduce expenditures on staffing and maintenance may explain why ruin and decay are common motifs in the industry. 
[^2]: Due to the unique complexities of managing that relationship, most owners prefer to avoid cults altogether. Typically, a cult will operate its own dungeon with a minimum of external partnerships.
[^3]: Even snake pits can be expensive if the snakes need to be imported or bewitched.
[^4]: "Puzzles" are one of the amenities that a dungeon can select in its AirDnD listing, so the experience provided by the blind monk can still be obtained by interested parties.
