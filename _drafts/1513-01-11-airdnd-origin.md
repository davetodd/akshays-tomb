## The Backstory

A formative moment in the conception of AirDnD occurred in the Dungeon of Sausocles, while Tornald Goldencleave was taking a long rest. He had just completed a quest for the emerald emulator, and he was tired of fiddling with the device, which was supposed to be capable of rendering any object in an emerald’s translucent, green hue. In frustration, Goldencleave threw the emulator at the wall, narrowly missing a small tiefling whom he had not noticed.

Believing that he had cleared the dungeon, Goldencleave was surprised by the tiefling’s presence. The tiefling, for its part, glared at Goldencleave before continuing to swap blood and kobold guts from the wall. Over the course of his stay, Goldencleave observed other tieflings cleaning, removing corpses, and resetting traps.

On subsequent quests, Goldencleave devoted more and more perception to dungeon logistics. He found it increasingly difficult to work with traditional adventuring parties; his companions usually began slaughtering the staff before he could properly study their organizational hierarchy.

After several months of frustration, Goldencleave began seeking out dungeons that had already been investigated or cleared. He struck up conversation with half-orcs as they returned with carts of recently felled game. He became acquainted with the wandering dwarves who designed new traps.

Eventually, he began to meet the dungeon lords. Very few lived in their own dungeons; most returned only to meet new tenants or cleanup of the entrails of former ones. These dungeon lords had limited access to the adventuring rumor mill, so Goldencleave took on the occasional quest for them. 

One such quest was on behalf of a dungeon lord whose staff kept filing worker’s compensation claims for the acid scarring they received from the dripping ceiling. Goldencleave had nearly completed the quest (he was staked out in the attic of a local worker’s compensation attorney) when he was visited by a changeling in the dungeon’s lord employ. The changeling had traveled through the fey to inform Goldencleave that his services were no longer needed.

Neither the dungeon lord nor his staff were forthcoming about the quest’s cancellation, but Goldencleave was able to kidnap a salesfaun on its way out of the dungeon. The faun worked for the newly incorporated Monster Dot Company. Apparently, the Monster Dot Company was operating a jobs board for dungeon lords. Goldencleave’s former patron had just used it to recruit several new acid-immune employees.

Goldencleave was struck by a realization with such force that he cast Detect Invisibility to make sure no one had just hit him with a quarterstaff. He was wasting his life performing one menial quest after another when the real reward was in brokering them for others. He offered the faun a new job on the spot (he would regret this after learning about the faun’s non-compete), and they began market research in earnest.

## The Founding

### Learning from the Monster Dot Company

1. He needed to act as a broker between dungeons and X. Monster Dot Company still required a dungeon to staff its own house keeping crew. Why? Better to act as a temp agency.
1. He could use the fey for faster communication.

## The Launch

1. The margins for dungeon services are smaller. Dungeons know how to do this, it's just painful. Whereas the point of a dungeon is to attract adventurers <-- that's the business to be in.
1. He meets someone giften in arcanum. 
1. After recruiting adventures, the question from the dungeon lord is: what's next? So it was natural to stay in the rental business (with a subsidiary of AirDnD?).
