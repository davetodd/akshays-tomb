Akshay stood on a dock in Wallanport's southern wharf. He held a bow, arrow knocked, and watched the flags on the empty ships as they snapped in the evening wind. The wind was uneven, agitated, in a hurry to chase away the day's humidity. Akshay inhaled it through his nose as he raised the bow and drew.

He took aim at the mast of the Elmer-Anne, a sharking vessel, and steadied his arm against the tension in the string. He exhaled. Released.

The arrow arced towards the ship, missed the mast, and impaled the bulwark. That settles the second target, he thought, as he walked over to retrieve the arrow. Just hit the side of the Elmer-Anne.

Akshay was practicing the course that he had designed for tonight's tournament. He hoped that the wind would keep up all evening; the adjustments he was making would make it too easy on a still night.

The gap between the dock and the deck of the Elmer-Anne could be crossed via two loose planks. Akshay chose the wider one and went to work his arrow free from where it was stuck in the bulwark. He had permission from the captains, Milo and Drake, to be aboard at any time, even if they and their three person crew were absent.

At the moment, most of the sharking crews were land-side, haggling over their day's catch. They were in early today, because of the tides. Wallanport's southern and northern wharfs were seperated geographically be a narrow spit of rock that protruded for <distance> into the Inlet Sea. At low tide, the rock was just beneath the surface, and access to the southern wharf was restricted to <a smaller area>.

This inconvenience meant that the southern wharf was quieter and smaller. It was popular with sharkers and foreign importers who couldn't afford the berth fees in the northern wharf, which was managed by consultants from the Augur's customs division.

Akshay owned a small boat in a berth adjacent to the Elmer-Anne. He had never sailed his ship; before purchasing it, the harbormaster warned him that it wasn't seaworthy. That is, it would stay afloat while moored to the dock, but it was likely to capsize on open water. Akshay didn't mind. He lived on it, which was not uncommon in the southern wharf, and he built and sold arrows on it, which was extremely uncommon.

All of the other ships on the same dock were sharking vessels. His had been too, before its absentee owner fell four months behind on the berth fees, and the harbormaster repossessed it.

The sharkers, especially the crew of the Elmer-Anne, considered Akshay an eccentric, but a harmless one. It helped that he had a talent for mending anything with a sharp point, and that he was generous in helping the crew with their harpoons. More importantly, he knew a delicious recipe for particularly fatty cuts of fish, which < > sharks had plenty of. He had a <permanent> invitation to the Elmer-Anne to cook, eat, and gamble, and he enjoyed their gambling nearly as much as they did.

---

Several months before, Akshay and the crew had been on the deck of the Elmer-Anne, finishing dinner. Akshay was explaining the <archer's paradox> to Milo, who was sitting against the bulwark with his arm around Drake. Drake's eyes were closed, which meant he was bored, and Akshay was not surprised when he suddenly interrupted: "Which of us do you think would be the best shot?"

Akshay laughed and said, "Jersey, I'd wager." Jersey was the youngest and quietest of the crew.

"You'd wager," said Drake, opening his eyes and leaning forward.

Milo rolled his eyes. "That was on purpose. You said that on purpose. You could've just said, 'Jersey', or 'I don't think a single one of you could hit the side of a ship if <you were close enough to piss on it>.' But instead you had to say, 'I'd wager'."

Akshay held out his hands in mock innocence.

"How much would you wager?" asked Drake.

"Let me pick any three targets, and I'd wager half a mark that Jersey hits them before you."

Drake grinned. They all looked at Jersey. He shrugged. "I'd wager that's true."

"<Shit on all of you>" said Stace, the only woman on the crew, "Half a mark says I can hit <anything Akshay points his dick at> in fewer shots than any of you."

"<The hell you can>," said Horace. He was tall and heavy, with a deep, booming voice. "It's not a harpoon. You can't run up and stab the damn thing."

"I don't need to. Unlike you, I can actually see more than two meters in front of me --"

Actually, Horace could spot a fin in the dark at <distance>, but he frequently claimed sun-blindness as an excuse for ignoring people he owed money, and that had earned him a repuation.

"And Jersey's too weak to even pull the string back --"

"I am not!"

"And Milo won't bet if there's a chance he'll lose. So that leaves Drake, the world's least able man, as my only competition. You can all just pay me now."

They were all grinning. Drake rubbed his hands together. "So it's like this: buy in is half a mark, second place is money back, winner gets the pot. Akshay picks three targets, fewest shots wins."

Akshay stood. "I'll go get a bow."

Milo rolled his eyes at all of them. "Of course you will."

Akshay supplied a bow and arrows. He set three practice targets at various intervals along the dock. To their surprise, Drake missed only once. His gloating would have been insufferable had his enthusiasm not been so infectious. He rallied the crews of several other ships, and they began holding weekly tournaments.

The rules were codified: participants could enter with up to four arrows, at a quarter mark per arrow. Akshay would lay out the course, and participants had to hit each target in order. They could reuse an arrow after a hit, but a miss resulted in loss of the arrow. Often this was because the arrow was irretrievable, lost to the Inlet Sea. Since Akshay supplied all the arrows, they started paying him back out of the pot before paying out the winner.

---

This week, Akshay was going to have them hit <...>, the side of the Elmer-Anne, an empty salt barrel supplied by the crew of the Merry Belle, and <...>.

After reclaiming his arrow from the side of the Elmer-Anne, Akshay raised his bow and sighted at the salt barrel. He matched his breath to the gentle rocking of the ship as he watched a patch of white caps beating towards shore. On his next inhale he drew, and he heard a man say, "Five marks he goes wide left."

A familiar woman's voice replied, "<My God>, you're rude. I told you to watch."

Akshay caught his breath, then forced himself to exhale and release. The arrow hit the right side of the barrel and glanced off it, into the water. He frowned, just as the rough patch of waves passed under the ship and a gust of wind hit him.

"Lucky gust," said the man.

Akshay turned to look at him and said, "Five marks, then?"

The man laughed, and Akshay crossed the deck and the planks to the dock. "Eliza," he said, nodding at the woman.

"Akshay," she replied. "This is Cole. Apparently I've been talking about you too much, and he insisted on meeting you."

"Well," said Akshay, "It's five marks for the pleasure."

"Come on," said Cole. "I was joking."

Akshay raised his eyebrows. It was very bad form to interrupt someone mid-draw. Even the sharkers knew that.

The two men stared at each other.

"Oh, let it go," said Eliza.

"Would've been wide left, anyway, if the wind hadn't saved it," said Cole.

Akshay looked at Eliza and knew that she didn't need him to say, "That's not letting it go." He said it anyway.

"Look," she said. "I heard you've been running some kind of tournament out here. Something fun. I've been meaning to come down and see. And Cole's interested in some business out here, so I thought, why not tonight? But I see you're the only one here, so I must've heard wrong. We'll see you around."

"Fine," said Akshay.

Cole smiled with his mouth and not his eyes, and Akshay wished he still had an arrow so he could aim it at the man's face.

Akshay watched them walk back <down the dock> to shore. They passed Drake, who was on his way back to the Elmer-Anne.

"Who's that?" asked Drake, when he reached the ship. "Looked like <one hell of > a lamb-eating land-sider ."

"Doesn't matter. Where's Milo?"

"<something about repairs for tomorrow>. That woman's been out here now and again, hasn't she?"

"Yes. I have to get another arrow. Damn gust."

Akshay didn't bother practicing the rest of the course.

<>

The wind calmed, and Jersey won the tournament. It was his first win, and he only used one arrow. The celebration culminated in the young man getting dumped overboard, but Akshay had already gone back to his boat.

<Chapter 2>

The Elmer-Anne is in for maintenance, Cole arrives and offers to invest. Wants to get into sharking.

Hires an agile consultant for the sharking crews.

What is Akshay doing in the mean-time?

Akshay owned a small boat in Wallanport from which he built and sold arrows. He specialized in tournament arrows, which were higher margin than hunting arrows, and he absolutely refused to have anything to do with bows.

That is, he refused to have anything to do with bows commercially. <In fact>, he < ... > spent more time tinkering with his own bows than he spent building arrows. <He probably spent fore time on harpoons too>

When he was younger, he had apprenticed in an all-inclusive archery store. The store was on the verge of bankruptcy because the owner had disavowed the commonly held belief that free life time maintenance should be included with the purchase of any bow. Lacking substantial competitive, hobbyist, or mercenary clientele, it owed its solvency to an annual contract with the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur.

In the fifth year of Akshay's six year, non-transferable apprenticeship, Wallanport's procurement department shut down for two months so that its leadership team could embark on a vision quest. Rumor held that their quest led them to <Altair>, an island near Grivougne known primarily for its two lantern-lit, fully-catered golf courses.

When the leadership team returned to Wallanport, they declared that in order to better align their core competencies, an immediate reorganization would shift responsibility for the rangers' procurement to a cousin of Lord Wall. This cousin had returned from the quest with a <silver> trophy, awarded for performing "acts of great bravery in the defense of the reputation of Wallanport." Coincidentally, it was also rumored that, of the entire leadership team, he had shot the lowest cumulative score on Altair's northern course.

When the rangers' contract came up for renewal, Lord Wall's cousin declared that he would only do business with suppliers offering free bow maintenance. The store's owner was forced to publicly disavow his long-standing disavowal. News of this spread through Wallanport's target archery community, Akshay found himself restringing bows nearly full time, and the store went bankrupt anyway.

Asset liquidation was handled by consultants from the Augur's bankruptcy department. Akshay arrived at work one morning to find a team of dock workers packing up and carrying all of the store's inventory down to a small, flat bottomed hauler. They were overseen by a man in a stiff-collared tunic with a red lanyard around his neck -- the mandatory insignia of those employed by the Augur. There was a thin rectangle of parchment hooked to the lanyard, but it was turned the wrong way around, so Akshay couldn't read the name on it.

Akshay offered to help with the labor, and the man waved him inside. He scavenged around and filled two sacks with feather fletchings and steel blunt points. After reporting the contents of the sacks to the man, he carried them out of the store, but instead of taking them to the hauler, he hid them under a stack of discarded lumber behind the building.

Then he had a better idea.

He jogged towards the docks and caught up with two men in front of a dock-side inn. They were carrying a bundle of blue cedar dowels that hadn't yet been cut into shafts, and Akshay offered them each two marks to leave the cedar on the inn's porch and forget about it. They dumped the wood on the porch, directly in front of the door, and walked straight to the adjoining <tavern> -- the two marks were more than the Augur was paying for the day's work.

Akshay had to shove the cedar out of the way in order to enter the inn. He found the proprieter resting his elbows on a tall desk, staring vacantly across a small and empty common room. He glanced at Akshay, who said, "I've a delivery for M. Cheadle. The boys left it out front. You the one to watch it for him?"

The proprieter frowned. "No one of that name here," he said.

Akshay frowned back at him. "Ship's not due until tomorrow. You got him on the books for then?"

The proprieter flipped a page in one of the books on the desk. He shook his head, but before he could say anything, Akshay interrupted, "Then add him in quick. He won't want to hear that you forgot him."

"I didn't forget him; I never heard of him!"

"And don't forget his delivery," Akshay said, already on his way out. He closed the door over the proprieter's objections, noted the inn's name -- it was called the Early Inn -- and jogged the rest of the way to the hauler.

The boat floated low in the water, with two planks placed side by side between it and the dock. Instead of using these, Akshay grabbed the ship's railing and swung himself aboard.

"Hi!" he said, "Let me see your papers."

A man and woman were already on deck, and as nothing was currently being loaded, they were leaning against the railing. The woman seemed to be leaning casually, out of habit. The man was clearly holding on for balance, as gentle waves rocked the boat <in its mooring>. The boat was small enough that Akshay thought it unlikely to have a quartermaster, so he figured the woman must be the ship's captain. The man was wearing a red lanyard; he was probably a consultant from the bankruptcy division.

The woman glared at him, confirming his guess. "They in order, as they always is. And you owe me yours, if you planning to keep your feet on my boat."

"Not asking about yours," said Akshay, without looking at her. He pointed at the consultant. "M. Cheadle has first claim on some of this inventory. Let me see the bankruptcy papers."

"What?"

Akshay began ticking off his fingers. "There are two loads of cedar dowels, two hundred target points, one hundred broad points, and a packet of imported competition shafts, which M. Cheadle has first claim on. One load of cedar was already left for him at the Early Inn. Check the papers!"

"Who's M. Cheadle?"

Akshay put his hands on his hips, feigning exasperation. "You don't even have the papers, do you?"

"I don't even know what you're about. Bankruptcies don't have papers," said the consultant, emphasizing the word "papers".

"It's a legal proceeding, isn't it? Which means there are papers to document it?"

"Yes, everything's on file with the Augur, but that doesn't mean --"

"And you don't even have your copy! Come with me then." Akshay swung himself back to the dock.

The consultant grumbled to the captain, and the captain shrugged. "Let's go," Akshay said, clapping his hands twice. Then he turned and started to jog. He heard the man jump down after him, and without looking back, paced himself so that the man caught up with him just in front of the inn.

Akshay pointed at the cedar wood on the porch, and nodded his head at the door. "That's M. Cheadle's. Go ask about it."

As soon as the man entered the inn, Akshay ran.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship. With that at an obvious end, and without the professional certification it would have earned him, he risked deportation back across the Inlet Sea to Grivougne. Grivougne was no bad place, but the eyes of The Many were plentiful there, and Akshay's uncle had gone to a great deal of trouble to secure this apprenticeship. Probably to more trouble than he could manage twice.

As an unsponsored immigrant, Akshay would be unable to secure another apprenticeship on his own. The only other legal option, as he understood it, was to register a foreign-owned entity with the city and hire himself. Again, as an immigrant, Akshay wouldn't be able to incorporate the business in Wallanport, but it was common for foreign businesses to register there in order to conduct trade. It shouldn't matter that he had just invented the business; the city wouldn't verify that it actually existed, it would just charge an inordinate amount of money for the registration.

<map of Wallanport>

So Akshay ran to Lord Wall's manor, the bureaucratic center of Wallanport. The manor had tall, stone walls on all sides, the same ones from which the city derived half its name, despite the majority of the population living outside them. <Needs another entertaining description.> It was also home to the majority of Lord Wall's extended family, which made it less of a manor and more of an entire city district.

Lord Wall had several relatives who were nearly fanatical participants in the archery tournaments that rotated through the holdings along the coast of the Inlet Sea. Since the re-negotiation of the rangers' contract, Akshay had made regular deliveries to the manor. Several of these were to Eliza Wall, the niece of Lord Wall's cousin in the procurement department. She was a year or two older than Akshay, and she had recently annoyed the (former) owner of the store by demanding that Akshay specifically be the one to carve and assemble her monthly order of steel point, blue cedar tournament arrows. She said that she liked his craftsmanship.

It was still early in the morning, Eliza was at home, and Akshay soon had his audience. Without preamble, he explained that M. Cheadle had made a speculative purchase on the eve of the bankruptcy, and that Akshay had taken it on himself to find a buyer for the newly acquired inventory. He told Eliza (truthfully) that he had no interest in taking another apprenticeship and was hoping to use the opportunity to start his own shop.

If Eliza was willing to buy out M. Cheadle, Akshay could use that inventory to bootstrap his own operation, and he offered her the preference on any new line of arrows that he produced or acquired from elsewhere. On the tournament circuit, equipment was nearly as valued as performance, so she agreed. He warned her that the bankruptcy proceedings had complicated M. Cheadle's claim, and she told him that she would take care of it. The procurement department was no friend of the Augur.

Akshay gave the inn as M. Cheadle's address, and he loitered in a cafe for the next several hours before returning to it. He informed the proprieter that M. Cheadle had found a local buyer and would no longer be overnighting in Wallanport. If the proprieter pleased, he could forward all commmuncations to Akshay's own address. As Akshay had hoped, multiple consultants had come by with messages for M. Cheadle, and the proprieter was happy to extricate himself from the mess.

The next day, Akshay awoke to a knock on the door of his apartment. A man was there with a moving crew, sent by Eliza. Akshay led them down to the hauler, where the captain shrugged and told them to be quick about it. As there was no-one else present, Akshay directed the moving crew to unload all of the arrow building supplies. He ignored the bows and the already assembled arrows, since he assumed that those would be easier for the Augur to assign a liquidation value and potentially place a lien on.

When they were done, Akshay found himself standing on the dock with enough unassembled ammunition to stage an assault on a small fort. It was at this point that he realized that he had no place to take the supplies. His own apartment was far too small, and besides that, it wasn't commercially zoned. He planned to use the supplies as collateral to secure a loan to pay for a business registration, but that would take at least a week, which was far too long to leave anything sitting on any dock anywhere. In addition, the Augur staffed the small business savings and loan department, and while it was unlikely that they ever talked to the consultants over in bankruptcy, Akshay didn't want to take the chance.

As he stood there, thinking, he heard the ship's captain spit into the water behind him. She said, "Get a boat."

"What?"

"You got nowhere for that, do you? And you got forty five until some Augur lanyard gets here and I ship off. Go buy a cheap boat, and stash what you got. You keep up with the berth fee, you keep the boat there as long as you like."

"<Ma'am>," said Akshay simply and with great relief, and he bowed in thanks.

"Go see the harbormaster. He's sure as always got some boat repossessed from someone who's not fed the berths. I'll round you up a few movers if you got a half-mark each for them."

"Ah," said Akshay, realizing that the men from Eliza's original moving crew had already left, "Yes, please, thanks!"

The boat cost twenty marks, which was a great discount, because the harbormaster said it wasn't seaworthy. That is, it would stay afloat while moored to its berth, but it was likely to capsize in open water. It had a tiny cabin below deck, as well as bunks for a <crew> of six. His new supplies were moved over to the deck, and he personally carried them down into the <hold>, using the bunks as shelfs. Berth fees would cost as much as his apartment, but the boat had a small kitchen, so he figured that he would be no worse off once his lease ended.

Then he got to work on two orders for Eliza; her usual steel-head, blue-cedar, and then an experimental one where he practiced carving the nock <in some new way>.

<picture of arrow design>

Akshay had a message sent to Eliza with his new location, and when she came to visit him later that week, she laughed. "I expected a sign and a front door," she said from the dock.

It was a <warm, sunny day>, and Akshay was on deck. <He was playing [...]>

"Ah, well, I think you just sort of jump," he said, as he set down the fletching that he was threading onto a shaft.

Before he could offer her a hand, she had jumped aboard. She saw the board of <...> and said, "Ah, there's no sign, because there aren't any arrows here. This is just a floating <...>."

"Ah, no! One moment," he said, and he clambored down into the hold and <returned with her orders>.

<She nodded with curiosity as he explained the new nock (and arrow shape?).>

"You know that even if you want to run a business from a boat, you still need a mainland affiliate with a physical presense, right?"

"I was planning to register as a foreign trader."

"Sure," she said, "But until then, you're an independent. They can only keep a berth for seven days, and it's been five days since you bought this boat, yes?"

Akshay frowned. He liked the boat, and the location would have given him easy access to timber merchants waiting for their ships to clear customs. Ship-bound merchants were usually bored and a little anxious, and always happy to negotiate over some of the more exotic <species> and <sizes> that they worried would be unappealing to the Augur's engineering corps.

<Well, he reflected, there were still those sacks hidden behind the old store.> If the boat got confiscated, he could sell the fletchings for enough to buy passage back to Grivougne, returning with at least some semblance of dignity.

Eliza watched him in silence, rubbing her thumb along the feather of one of the new arrows that Akshay had made for her. Finally, she laughed. "I'll register for you," she said. "I think I have a brother-in-law with one or two unused subsidiaries that I could affiliate you with."

"Ah!" he replied.

"And then there's the matter of the ranger's new contract--."

"Ah," he said, much less cheerfully.

Eliza narrowed her eyes.

"I was hoping to avoid bulk commisions. It's --"

"Dull?" She laughed again. "I'll register you as "sports and leisure", so procurement won't be likely to notice when they go through the rolls. What are you calling this place?"

"Ah, well, the boat's called the Lady Beth."

She narrowed her eyes, <additional detail>. "No, it's not."

"It's my boat," he shrugged.

"And it might as well be my store. We'll call it <>."

Akshay bowed.

Eliza laughed and stepped off the Lady Beth. "I'll be back next month," she said. "After the tournament in Deignlann. Have something new for me!"
