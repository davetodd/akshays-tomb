Akshay owned a small boat in Wallanport from which he bought, sold, and crafted arrows. He specialized in tournament arrows, which were higher margin than hunting arrows, and he absolutely refused to have anything to do with bows.

When he was younger, he had apprenticed in an all-inclusive archery store on the verge of bankruptcy. Business was scarce because of the owner's disavowal of the commonly held belief that free life time maintenance should be included with the purchase of any bow. The store was sustained almost entirely from commisions for the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur.

In the fifth year of Akshay's six year, non-transferable apprenticeship, Wallanport's procurement department <had a re-org>, and responsibility for the rangers was transferred to a cousin of Lord Wall. This cousin declared that free bow maintenance was a prerequisite for any new contract, and the store's owner was forced to publicly disavow his disavowal. News of this spread through Wallanport's target archery community, and Akshay found himself restringing bows nearly full time.

The store soon went bankrupt, and proceedings were handled by consultants from the Augur's bankruptcy department.

Akshay arrived at work one morning to find a team of dock workers packing up and carrying all of the store's inventory down to a small, flat bottomed hauler. Akshay offered to help, and as no one even acknowledged him, he scavenged around and filled two sacks with feather fletchings and steel blunt points. Instead of carrying them to the hauler, he hid them under a stack of discarded lumber behind the store. Then he had a better idea.

He jogged towards the docks and caught up with two men in front of a dock-side inn. They were carrying a bundle of blue cedar that hadn't yet been cut into shafts, so he offered them each two marks to leave the cedar on the inn's porch and forget about it.

Then he went inside and found the proprieter seated behind a desk. Akshay said, "I've a delivery for M. Cheadle. The boys left it out front. You the one to watch it for him?"

The proprieter frowned. "No one of that name here," he said.

Akshay frowned back at him. "Ship's not due until tomorrow. You got him on the books for then?"

The proprieter flipped a page in one of the books on his desk. He shook his head, but before he could say anything, Akshay interrupted, "Then add him in quick. He won't want to hear that you forgot him."

"I didn't forget him; I never heard of him!"

"And don't forget his delivery," Akshay said, already on his way out of the inn. He closed the door over the proprieter's objections, and jogged the rest of the way to the hauler.

"Hi!" he shouted, jumping onboard. "Let me see your papers!"

Nothing was currently being loaded on to the deck, and the two men who were already onboard were leaning against the ship's railing. One of them looked to be doing this for comfort and the other for balance. The boat was small enough that Akshay thought it unlikely to require a quartermaster, so he figured that the comfortable looking man must be the ship's captain. The other was probably a consultant for the Augur.

The captain glared at him, confirming his guess. "They in order, as they always is. And you owe me yours, if you planning to keep your feet on my boat."

"Not asking about yours," said Akshay, without looking at him. He pointed at the consultant. "M. Cheadle has first claim on some of this inventory. Let me see the bankruptcy papers."

"What?"

Akshay began ticking off his fingers. "There are two loads of cedar <shafts>, two hundred target points, one hundred broad points, and a packet of imported competition shafts, which M. Cheadle has first claim on. One load of cedar was already left for him at the Early Inn. Check the papers!"

"Who's M. Cheadle?"

Akshay put his hands on his hips, feigning exasperation. "You don't even have the papers, do you?"

"I don't even know what you're about. Bankruptcies don't have _papers_," said the consultant.

"It's a legal proceeding, isn't it? Which means there are papers to document it?"

"Yes, everything's on file with the Augur."

"And you don't even have your copy! Come with me then." Akshay jumped back down to the dock.

The consultant grumbled to the captain, and the captain shrugged. "Let's go," Akshay said, and he clapped his hands twice. Then he turned and started to jog. He heard someone jump down after him, and without looking back, he paced himself so that the consultant caught up to him just in front of the inn.

Akshay pointed at the cedar wood on the porch, and nodded his head at the door. "That's M. Cheadle's. Go ask about it."

As soon as the man entered the inn, Akshay ran.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship, and he had no interest in starting a new one. But without a certification, he'd be ineligble for anything except manual labor, unless he could find the money to fund himself. So he ran to Lord Wall's manor, which was the bureaucratic center of Wallanport. It was also home to the majority of Lord Wall's extended family, which made it less of a manor and more of an entire city district.

Lord Wall had several relatives who were nearly fanatical participants in the archery tournaments that rotated through the holdings around the Inlet Sea. Since the re-negotiation between the cousin of Lord Wall and the store's owner, Akshay had made regular deliveries to the manor. Several of these were to Lady Eliza Wall, the niece of Lord Wall's cousin. She was a year or two older than Akshay, and she had recently annoyed the (former) owner of the store by demanding that Akshay specifically be the one to carve and assemble her monthly order of steel point, blue cedar tournament arrows. She said that she liked his craftsmanship.

It was still early in the morning, Lady Eliza was at home, and Akshay soon had his audience. He explained that M. Cheadle had made a speculative purchase on the eve of the bankruptcy, and that Akshay had taken it on himself to find a buyer for the newly acquired inventory. He told Eliza (truthfully) that he had no interest in taking another apprenticeship and was hoping to use the opportunity to start his own shop.

If Eliza was willing to buy out M. Cheadle, Akshay could use that inventory to bootstrap his own operation, and he offered her the preference on any new line of arrows that he produced or acquired from elsewhere. On the tournament circuit, equipment was nearly as valued as performance, so she agreed. He warned her that the bankruptcy proceedings had complicated M. Cheadle's claim, and she told him that she would take care of it. He gave the inn as M. Cheadle's address.

Akshay spent the next several hours loitering in a cafe and then went back to the inn. He informed the proprieter that M. Cheadle had found a local buyer and would no longer be overnighting in Wallanport. If the proprieter pleased, he could forward all commmuncations to Akshay's own address. As Akshay had hoped, multiple consultants had come by with messages for M. Cheadle, and the proprieter was happy to extricate himself from the mess.

The next day, Akshay awoke to a knock on the door of his apartment. A man was there with a moving crew, sent by Lady Eliza. Akshay led them down to the hauler, where the captain shrugged and told them to be quick about it. As there were no consultants present, Akshay directed the moving crew to unload all of the arrow building supplies. He ignored the bows, bow making equipment, and any already assembled arrows, since he assumed that those would be easier for the Augur to <value>, and potentially place a <lien> on.

When they were done, Akshay found himself standing on the dock with enough unassembled ammunition to make a ranged assault on a small fort. It was at this point that he realized that he had no place to take the supplies. His own apartment was far too small, and also wasn't zoned for commercial business. He had some money, and he could use the supplies as collateral for a business loan, but he'd have to register a business first. This would take at least a week, which was far too long to leave anything sitting on any dock anywhere. In addition, the Augur staffed the <new-business> department, and while it was unlikely that they ever talked to the consultants over in bankruptcy, Akshay didn't want to take the chance.

As he stood there, thinking, he heard the ship's captain spit into the water behind him. Then the captain said, "Get a boat."

"What?"

"You got nowhere for that, do you? And you got forty five minutes until a consultant gets here and I ship off. Go to the harbormaster, buy a cheap boat, and stash what you got. As long as you pay the berth fees, you keep it as long as you like."

"Sir," said Akshay, and as thanks, he executed a formal bow.

"Go see the harbormaster. I'll round you up a few movers if you got a half-mark each."

"Ah," said Akshay, realizing that the men from Lady Eliza's original moving crew had left, "Yes, please, thanks!"

<Akshay buys a boat.>

<He makes a regular order for Eliza, and a custom one.>

When Lady Eliza finally came to visit him, she laughed. "You know that if you want to keep conducting business out of here, you have to register? Even if you're in a boat."

"I was planning to register as an independent trader."

"Can't," she said, shaking her head. "They can only keep a berth for seven days."

"But what about <affiliated traders>?"

"All the affiliates are registered with a mainland address."

Akshay frowned. He liked the boat, and the location would give him easy access to timber merchants waiting for their ships to clear customs. Ship-bound merchants were usually bored and a little anxious, and always happy to negotiate over some of the more exotic <species> and <sizes> that they worried would be unappealing to the Augur's engineering corps.

Eliza rubbed her thumb along the feather of one of the <> arrows as she watched him. Then she laughed. "I'll register for you," she said.

"Oh!" he replied.

"The rangers will need a new contract anyway."

"Oh," he said, much less cheerfully.

Eliza narrowed her eyes.

"I was hoping to avoid bulk commisions. It's --"

"Dull?" She laughed again. "I'll register you as "sports and leisure", so procurement won't be likely to notice you when they go through the rollw. And what shall be the name of this fine establishment?"

"Ah, well, the boat's called the Lady Beth."

She narrowed her eyes again. "No, it's not."

"It's my boat," he shrugged.

"And it might as well be my store. <Akshay's Arrows>. Simple and alliterative."

<what are the effects of water on wood / arrows / warping?>
