Akshay looked towards the forest that bordered their little clearing. A tall, slender man limped in their direction, coming in and out of sight as he passed behind thick fir trees. The man continued several paces into the clearing before he stopped and frowned at the disorderly camp that Akshay and thirty or so other refugees had made there.

The refugees were nearly all professionals and artisans who had fled Wallanport before the Augur laid siege.

<Akshay owned a small shop near the docks where he <manufactured> arrows. He liked the location because it gave him easy access to timber merchants who were waiting for their ships to clear customs. The ship-bound merchants were usually bored and a little anxious, so they were happy to negotiate over some of the more exotic <species> and <sizes> that they worried would be unappealing to the <construction barons>.

Akshay usually worked on commission for a pair of Lord Wall's nieces who participated in archery tournaments throughout the holdings of the <Inlet Sea>. The nieces were ambitious but only moderately talented, so they were regularly pushing <Akshay to innovate [how does this jive with Akshay not having used a particular type of spruce]>

Each of them was friendly with at least one of Lord Wall's many grandchildren, so rumors of the broken treaty had reached them before the gates closed.

The details of the breakdown were unclear. The Augur's engineers maintained the city's primary aqueduct, and a dozen or so clerks worked at the university and on Lord Wall's manor. Several people claimed to have seen the entire Augur staff hurriedly exit the manor, and others said that a contingent of clerks had been locked in the university chapel. Had several prolonged failures in the aqueduct precipitated a confrontation? Or was it due to the recent publication of several particularly private letters written by Lord Wall's second daughter, and the subsequent street performances using them as source material?

<Akshay was among those who heard the rumors and left before the gates closed.> He planned to spend the night camping in the hills overlooking Wallanport. It was an excellent vantage point for watching traffic into and out of the city. The temperature was comfortable enough for sleeping outside, so they would not be too inconvenienced if the rumors turned out to be false.

Several hours before dawn, they discovered what an excellent vantage point it was for watching the lanterns of the Augur's ships as they appeared on the horizon and floated slowly down the river towards the city.

They could see very clearly when the docks went up in flames.

It occurred to Akshay, as he listened to distant screams, that if the cause of the conflagration was the Augur's purported demand for a greater share of the city's revenue (as he had heard), then the docks were a poor target. Most of the ships berthed there were foreign traders, and a large percentage of Wallanport's wealth came from customs duty. Considering the additional fees from leasing the berths, it seemed a suspect long term monetization strategy. Then Akshay heard a dog barking, which made him sad, and this made him feel guilty because there were still humans screaming.

Feeling sick to his stomach, he gathered up his pack and bedroll and began walking. The hills to the west of Wallanport are a relatively small geographic feature, and by morning he had descended them. When he reached the road to Freehull, he stopped and ate a slice of bread and aged cheese. Then he kept walking.
