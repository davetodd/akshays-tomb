Akshay owned a small boat in Wallanport from which he built and sold arrows. He specialized in tournament arrows, which were higher margin than hunting arrows, and he absolutely refused to have anything to do with bows.

When he was younger, he had apprenticed in an all-inclusive archery store. The store was on the verge of bankruptcy because the owner had disavowed the commonly held belief that free life time maintenance should be included with the purchase of any bow. Lacking most competitive, hobbyist, or mercenary clientele, it instead owed its solvency to an annual contract with the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur.

In the fifth year of Akshay's six year, non-transferable apprenticeship, Wallanport's procurement department shut down for two months in order to go questing after their core competencies. The result was a reorganization that shifted responsibility for the rangers to a cousin of Lord Wall. The cousin declared that free bow maintenance would be a prerequisite for any new contract, so the store's owner was forced to publicly disavow his disavowal. News of this spread through Wallanport's target archery community, and Akshay found himself restringing bows nearly full time.

The store went bankrupt anyway.

Asset liquidation was handled by consultants from the Augur's bankruptcy department. Akshay arrived at work one morning to find a team of dock workers packing up and carrying all of the store's inventory down to a small, flat bottomed hauler. Akshay offered to help, and as no one even acknowledged him, he scavenged around and filled two sacks with feather fletchings and steel blunt points. Instead of carrying them to the hauler, he hid them under a stack of discarded lumber behind the store.

Then he had a better idea.

He jogged towards the docks and caught up with two men in front of a dock-side inn. They were carrying a bundle of blue cedar that hadn't yet been cut into shafts, so he offered them each two marks to leave the cedar on the inn's porch and forget about it. They dumped the wood on the porch, in front of the door, and Akshay had to shove it out of the way in order to get the door open.

He entered the inn -- it was called the Early Inn -- and found the proprieter resting his elbows on a tall desk, staring vacantly at the small, clean, empty common room. He glanced at Akshay, who said, "I've a delivery for M. Cheadle. The boys left it out front. You the one to watch it for him?"

The proprieter frowned. "No one of that name here," he said.

Akshay frowned back at him. "Ship's not due until tomorrow. You got him on the books for then?"

The proprieter flipped a page in one of the books on the desk. He shook his head, but before he could say anything, Akshay interrupted, "Then add him in quick. He won't want to hear that you forgot him."

"I didn't forget him; I never heard of him!"

"And don't forget his delivery," Akshay said, already on his way out. He closed the door over the proprieter's objections, and jogged the rest of the way to the hauler.

The hauler was painted in the Augur's red, and unlike most of the ships berthed in Wallanport, it lacked a romantic name. Instead, emblazoned on the hull in block letters, was the number "17".

It was really a very small ship, floating low in the water, so Akshay grabbed its railing and swung himself aboard.

"Hi!" he said, "Let me see your papers."

A man and woman were already on deck, and as nothing was currently being loaded, they were leaning against the ship's railing. The woman seemed to be leaning casually, out of habit. The man was clearly holding on for balance, as gentle waves rocked the boat in its mooring. The boat was small enough that Akshay thought it unlikely to have a quartermaster, so he figured the woman must be the ship's captain. The man was probably a consultant for the Augur.

The woman glared at him, confirming his guess. "They in order, as they always is. And you owe me yours, if you planning to keep your feet on my boat."

"Not asking about yours," said Akshay, without looking at her. He pointed at the consultant. "M. Cheadle has first claim on some of this inventory. Let me see the bankruptcy papers."

"What?"

Akshay began ticking off his fingers. "There are two loads of cedar <shafts>, two hundred target points, one hundred broad points, and a packet of imported competition shafts, which M. Cheadle has first claim on. One load of cedar was already left for him at the Early Inn. Check the papers!"

"Who's M. Cheadle?"

Akshay put his hands on his hips, feigning exasperation. "You don't even have the papers, do you?"

"I don't even know what you're about. Bankruptcies don't have papers," said the consultant, emphasizing the word "papers".

"It's a legal proceeding, isn't it? Which means there are papers to document it?"

"Yes, everything's on file with the Augur, but that doesn't mean --"

"And you don't even have your copy! Come with me then." Akshay swung himself back to the dock.

The consultant grumbled to the captain, and the captain shrugged. "Let's go," Akshay said and clapped his hands twice. Then he turned and started to jog. He heard the man jump down after him, and without looking back, paced himself so that the man caught up to him just in front of the inn.

Akshay pointed at the cedar wood on the porch, and nodded his head at the door. "That's M. Cheadle's. Go ask about it."

As soon as the man entered the inn, Akshay ran.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship, which his uncle had sponsored. That was obviously now at an end, and he was still a year short of earning his tradesman certification. Without either certification or apprenticeship, he risked deportation back across the Inlet Sea to Grivougne. Grivougne was no bad place, but the eyes of The Many were plentiful there, and Akshay's uncle had gone to a great deal of trouble to secure this apprenticeship. Probably to more trouble than he could manage twice.

The only other option, legally, was to secure citizenship as a registered business owner, which required more money than Akshay had earned as an apprentice. So he ran to Lord Wall's manor, which was the bureaucratic center of Wallanport.

It was also home to the majority of Lord Wall's extended family, which made it less of a manor and more of an entire city district. Lord Wall had several relatives who were nearly fanatical participants in the archery tournaments that rotated through the holdings that bordered the Inlet Sea. Since the re-negotiation of the rangers' contract, Akshay had made regular deliveries to the manor. Several of these were to Lady Eliza Wall, the niece of Lord Wall's cousin. She was a year or two older than Akshay, and she had recently annoyed the (former) owner of the store by demanding that Akshay specifically be the one to carve and assemble her monthly order of steel point, blue cedar tournament arrows. She said that she liked his craftsmanship.

It was still early in the morning, Lady Eliza was at home, and Akshay soon had his audience. Without preamble, he explained that M. Cheadle had made a speculative purchase on the eve of the bankruptcy, and that Akshay had taken it on himself to find a buyer for the newly acquired inventory. He told Eliza (truthfully) that he had no interest in taking another apprenticeship and was hoping to use the opportunity to start his own shop.

If Eliza was willing to buy out M. Cheadle, Akshay could use that inventory to bootstrap his own operation, and he offered her the preference on any new line of arrows that he produced or acquired from elsewhere. On the tournament circuit, equipment was nearly as valued as performance, and she agreed. He warned her that the bankruptcy proceedings had complicated M. Cheadle's claim, and she told him that she would take care of it. He gave the inn as M. Cheadle's address.

Akshay spent the next several hours loitering in a cafe and then went back to the inn. He informed the proprieter that M. Cheadle had found a local buyer and would no longer be overnighting in Wallanport. If the proprieter pleased, he could forward all commmuncations to Akshay's own address. As Akshay had hoped, multiple consultants had come by with messages for M. Cheadle, and the proprieter was happy to extricate himself from the mess.

The next day, Akshay awoke to a knock on the door of his apartment. A man was there with a moving crew, sent by Lady Eliza. Akshay led them down to the hauler, where the captain shrugged and told them to be quick about it. As there were no consultants present, Akshay directed the moving crew to unload all of the arrow building supplies. He ignored the bows, bow making equipment, and any already assembled arrows, since he assumed that those would be easier for the Augur to <value> and potentially place a <lien> on.

When they were done, Akshay found himself standing on the dock with enough unassembled ammunition to stage an assault on a small fort. It was at this point that he realized that he had no place to take the supplies. His own apartment was far too small, and besides that, it wasn't commercially zoned. He planned to use the supplies as collateral for securing a loan and business registration, but that would take at least a week, which was far too long to leave anything sitting on any dock anywhere. In addition, the Augur staffed the small business savings and loan department, and while it was unlikely that they ever talked to the consultants over in bankruptcy, Akshay didn't want to take the chance.

As he stood there, thinking, he heard the ship's captain spit into the water behind him. She said, "Get a boat."

"What?"

"You got nowhere for that, do you? And you got forty five until some Augur stiff collar gets here and I ship off. Go buy a cheap boat, and stash what you got. You keep up with the berth fee, you keep the boat there as long as you like."

"<Ma'am>," said Akshay simply and with great relief, and he bowed in thanks.

"Go see the harbormaster. He's sure as always got some boat repossessed from someone who's not fed the berths. I'll round you up a few movers if you got a half-mark each for them."

"Ah," said Akshay, realizing that the men from Lady Eliza's original moving crew had left, "Yes, please, thanks!"

The boat cost twenty marks, because the harbormaster said it wasn't seaworthy. That is, it would stay afloat while moored to its berth, but it was likely to capsize on open water. It had a tiny cabin below deck, as well as bunks for a crew of six. His new supplies were moved over to the deck, and he personally carried them down into the hold, using the bunks as shelfs. Berth fees would cost as much as his apartment, but the boat had a small kitchen, so he figured that he would be no worse off once the lease ended.

Then he got to work on two orders for Lady Eliza; her usual steel-head, blue-cedar, and then an experimental one where he practiced carving the nock <in some new way>.

He had a message sent to her with his new location, and when she came to visit him later that week, she laughed. "I was expecting a front door of some sort," she said from the dock.

It was a warm, sunny day, and Akshay was working on deck. "Ah, well, I think you just sort of jump," he said, as he set down the fletchings that he had <been attaching>.

Before he could offer her a hand, she had jumped aboard. "One moment," he said, and he climbed down into the hold and <returned with her orders>.

<She nodded with curiosity as he explained the new nock (and arrow shape?).>

"You know that if you want to run a business from a boat, you need to register with a mainland affiliate?"

"I was planning to register as an independent trader."

"Can't," she said, shaking her head. "They can only keep a berth for seven days."

"Ah. Well, one moment."

"It's been five days since you bought this bought, yes?"

Akshay frowned. He liked the boat, and the location would have given him easy access to timber merchants waiting for their ships to clear customs. Ship-bound merchants were usually bored and a little anxious, and always happy to negotiate over some of the more exotic <species> and <sizes> that they worried would be unappealing to the Augur's engineering corps.

In two days, apparently, his days as a small business owner would be at a legal end. Well, he reflected, there were still those sacks hidden behind the old store. If the boat got confiscated, he could sell the fletchings for enough to buy passage back to Grivougne, and at least return with some semblance of dignity.

Eliza watched him in silence, rubbing her thumb along the feather of one of the new arrows that Akshay had made for her. Finally, she laughed. "I'll register for you," she said. "I think I have a brother-in-law with one or two unused subsidiaries that I could affiliate you with."

"Ah!" he replied.

"And then there's the matter of the ranger's new contract--."

"Ah," he said, much less cheerfully.

Eliza narrowed her eyes.

"I was hoping to avoid bulk commisions. It's --"

"Dull?" She laughed again. "I'll register you as "sports and leisure", so procurement won't be likely to notice when they go through the rolls. What are you calling this place?"

"Ah, well, the boat's called the Lady Beth."

She narrowed her eyes again. "No, it's not."

"It's my boat," he shrugged.

"And it might as well be my store. We'll call it <>."

Akshay bowed.

Eliza stuck out her tongue and stepped off the Lady Beth. "I'll be back next month," she said. "After the tournament in Deignlann. <Surprise me>."
