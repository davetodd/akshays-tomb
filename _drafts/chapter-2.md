"God, Akshay, tell me a story."

So he told her the whole story of how the store had started. She laughed.

"What's on your mind?"

<Lady Eliza shows up with gossip.>

The details of the breakdown were unclear. The Augur's engineers maintained the city's primary aqueduct, and a dozen or so clerks worked at the university and on Lord Wall's manor. Several people claimed to have seen the entire Augur staff hurriedly exit the manor, and others said that a contingent of clerks had been locked in the university chapel. Had several prolonged failures in the aqueduct precipitated a confrontation? Or was it due to the recent publication of several particularly private letters written by Lord Wall's second daughter, and the subsequent street performances using them as source material?

<akshay leaves with several others who had no debts to Lord Wall that oblige them to stay and fight>

Akshay planned to spend the night camping in the hills overlooking Wallanport. It was an excellent vantage point for watching traffic into and out of the city. The temperature was comfortable enough for sleeping outside, so they would not be too inconvenienced if the rumors turned out to be false.

Several hours before dawn, they discovered what an excellent vantage point it was for watching the lanterns of the Augur's ships as they appeared on the horizon and floated slowly down the river towards the city.

They could see very clearly when the docks went up in flames.

It occurred to Akshay, as he listened to distant screams, that if the cause of the conflagration was the Augur's purported demand for a greater share of the city's revenue (as he had heard), then the docks were a poor target. Most of the ships berthed there were foreign traders, and a large percentage of Wallanport's wealth came from customs duty. Considering the additional fees from leasing the berths, it seemed a suspect long term monetization strategy. Then Akshay heard a dog barking, which made him sad, and this made him feel guilty because there were still humans screaming.

Feeling sick to his stomach, he gathered up his pack and bedroll and began walking. The hills to the west of Wallanport are a relatively small geographic feature, and by morning he had descended them. When he reached the road to Freehull, he stopped and ate a slice of bread and aged cheese. Then he kept walking.

Akshay reached the clearing that marked the edge of Lord Wall's holdings just as the sun began to set.
and Freehull just as the sun began to set. Freehull, as far as the Wallanporters were concerned, was little more than a large tract of trees with a small estate somewhere in the middle. For at least two decades, it had been administered by a woman who called herself Founder May. There was very little trade between Wallanport and her estate, despite their proximity.

<The refugees were nearly all professionals and artisans who had fled Wallanport before the Augur laid siege.>

<Each of them was friendly with at least one of Lord Wall's many grandchildren, so rumors of the broken treaty had reached them before the gates closed.>

After some discussion, the loosely assembled group decided to camp in the clearing. The night was warm, and most of the travellers were well stocked with food, so bartering was brisk and convivial. There was much talk about politics and none about death.

The next morning, some of the others continued onwards, but Akshay stayed in the camp. He had never been to Freehull before, and he wanted to wait for news from Wallanport. He spent several hours being talked to by a barrister named Malcolm. <Make Malcolm a woman.> Malcolm was short, with a large head and very small feet that Akshay kept squinting at to make sure they were really as out of proportion as they seemed.

<More about Malcolm. Akshay decided to stop talking to him.>

In the evening, two teenagers, a brother and sister, reached the camp from Wallanport. They said that the fire had spread and the aqueduct had been sabotaged. This was unsurprising, concluded the others, and Lord Wall would probably sue for peace. His only alternative was to hire a mercenary arms and repair division from the Independent Nation of Orsland, but the amount of time for messengers to even reach the I.N.O. could be prohibitive.

This discussion continued for several minutes until the sister quietly interrupted and asked if they might have something to eat.

There were no more arrivals from Wallanport for the next three days, at which point they calculated that the city was out of fresh water. Malcolm, the barrister, started rallying a party to go back to investigate. The teenagers thought this was a bad idea, but did not elaborate. Nevertheless, Malcolm and three others began soliciting donations for extra travelling food.

To avoid them, Akshay spent the morning and most of the afternoon in the surrounding forest <looking for spruces>. <He is a an arrow maker by trade.>

Malcolm's party had not departed when Akshay returned to the camp. They didn't leave on the next day either, and Akshay suspected that they had consumed all of their extra travelling food by the following day, when the tall man walked out of the forest.

Akshay looked towards the forest that bordered their little clearing. A tall, slender man limped in their direction, coming in and out of sight as he passed behind thick fir trees. The man continued several paces into the clearing before he stopped and frowned at the disorderly camp that Akshay and thirty or so other refugees had made there.

The man had come from roughly the same direction that Akshay had explored, and Akshay had not noticed any trails or other signs of human disturbance. But the man was well dressed, wearing a freshly pressed tunic and burgundy neck tie under a cape that stretched just past his waist. His boots flared stylishly at the knee. Given the attire and his pronounced limp, Akshay did not think that he had travelled very far.

The man continued to frown at the camp, then sighed and tried to smile pleasantly. Then he said, "Now that your seven day land use trial has ended, who intends to continue in our extended residence program?"

After a brief silence, the man said in a tired voice, "As you know, Freehull considers property to be a public commodity, and welcomes visitors to reside where they please for up to seven days. After that, extended residence costs one half-mark per day, to be presented bimonthly at the Freehull Estate Administration Center. Any additional non-land usage has an additional surcharge, as you would expect."

None of the Wallanporters replied. The man looked around, exasperated. "Seriously, people?"

He stalked unevenly to the carved wooden sign that read "Freehull". The sign was in the middle of the clearing, loosely at the center of the camp. Victoria, a stocky woman who sourced animal parts for apothecaries, was sitting on her bedroll immediately in front of it. The man stopped and glared down at her.

"As you would expect," he said to them all, "If you had bothered to read the terms of the land you are now in." To Victoria, he said, "While you are entitled to reside where you please when in Freehull," and he closed his eyes, "Would you please move yourself from the _specific_ piece of land on which you are now residing."

"What?" she said. "Why?"

"Oh, come on," he said, opening his eyes. "For a minute."

She hesitated before standing and stepping to the side of her bedroll. The man kicked it aside. Several of the Wallanporters grumbled, but the man ignored them and started kicking at the dirt in front of the sign. He soon unearthed a small box.

"Would you please pick that up for me?" he said to Victoria.

"No," she replied.

He glared at her, huffed, and carefully kneeled down to pick it up. After shaking off more dirt, he opened the box and pulled out a parchment. He unrolled this and read aloud: "Welcome to Freehull. Visitors are entitled to seven days residence on any uncontested property, after which they will be charged one half-mark per day... and it goes on."

He looked around and added, "As you would expect."

"I wouldn't expect that," said Malcolm loudly. He was seated at the back of the camp, with his feet tucked under him.

"Why not? Are you daft?"

"No, but I would expect all regulations to be posted clearly in an accessible location --"

The man interrupted and gestured to the box, "What was inaccessible about that?"

"It was buried underground!" exclaimed Malcolm. "Under most established regional common law, regulations in an underground box would not be considered clear or accessible. They should be posted in plain sight on walls or --"

"Do you see any walls here?" scoffed the man. "We understand that you have your laws. Different land, different laws. We understand this, so we make our terms immediately accessible to all travelers who enter our borders. Look at the arrow on the Freehull sign. It is very clearly pointing down, in commonly understood vernacular, to where one can find all relevant terms and conditions."

"I thought that was pointing in the direction of Freehull," said Victoria.

The man looked at her, dumbfounded. "You thought that Freehull was... underground?"

"No, I thought the arrow meant it was straight ahead and that someone had just carved it upside down."

"You thought..." The man shook his head in disbelief. He continued to shake his head as he put the scroll back into the box and the box back into the hole. He slowly got to his feet and kicked some dirt over the box, saying, "Your extended residence fees are due at the Estate Administration Center at the end of the month. Your initial billing period will be pro-rated, as you would expect."

Then he began limping back towards the trees.

"Where's the Administration Center?" someone called after him.

"Down the road," he said, without looking back. "If you leave early, you can make it before the inn closes, although not before the Center itself closes."

"Then where you are going?"

"Back the way I came, as you would expect. Honestly, you people..."

Then Malcolm shouted, "But I'm not even in Freehull!"

The man stopped at that and turned, saying angrily, "I do not know how visitors are received in Lord Wall's land, but I find bad jokes from guests I have only recently met to be in very poor taste."

"Well, I'm still on Lord Wall's side of that sign. You don't presume to apply your laws to his land as well, do you?"

"This entire clearing is part of Freehull," said the man, speaking slowly. "We cannot place a sign at the very _edge_ of our territory, because that would imply placing our regulation box in the _adjacent_ territory." He continued at a faster, angrier clip, saying, "This is all defined very clearly in the appendices referenced by the fourth paragraph in the terms in the box, which you are welcome to dig back up at your own convenience."

"Where are these appendices? Up at the top of one of those trees?" asked Malcolm. "I need to see them in their entirety before I can evaluate the veracity of your claims."

"There are copies available in the Administration Center," said the man, and he limped off into the forest.

No one said anything until he was out of sight, at which point they heard him shout, "As you would expect!"
