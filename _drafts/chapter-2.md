Eliza visited the boat once a month for the next three years.

"How was Deignlann?" Akshay would ask. "Grivougne? Ternfelden?" Or wherever the most recent tournament had been.

Eliza would laugh, jump aboard the boat, and seat herself cross-legged on the deck. Then she would describe the set up of the course (she was an avid field archer) and all the shots she had taken, in perfect chronological order.

Akshay would ask about the weather, the wind, the arrows, the competitors. His hands always stayed busy, <threading a fletching> or heating a shaft above his portable cooking pot so that he could straighten some unseen curve. Inevitably, Eliza would ask him what he was doing, and he would smile and say, "next month". Then he would go below deck to retrieve the order that he had prepared for her.

Akshay always gave her two <packets> of arrows, one requested by her, one invented by him. [She never paid in person; always the same little man would come the next day with a line of credit <on> the manor.]

Sometimes, after inquiring about his latest experiments and pressing him for the latest <developments in the trade>, she shared the latest gossip from the manor. This was, for instance, how he learned that construction of the city's new aqueduct had been delayed because of a dispute between the procurement department and the Augur's engineers. The procurement department was the only bureaucratic function that reported directly to Lord Wall, rather than having been contracted from the Augur. This was ostensibly so that all purchases made by the Augur on behalf of Wallanport could be reconciled against the bill for its annual consulting fees. However, as the city relied on the Augur for auditing, it was unclear whether this reconciliation was ever performed correctly (or at all).

Apparently, one of the Augur's engineers had submitted a reimbursement request for a herd of cats. The aqueduct was <fully connected to the river>, but the <gate at the river> hadn't been opened. The aqueduct was an enclosed channel, and construction had taken so long, that it had supposedly had a rat infestation. It was build with an overflow channel that drained into the Inlet Sea, so <opening the river gate but not the city gate> would flush the rats out to sea via the overflow drainage and the problem would be solved. But procurement's legal team refused to sign off on the grounds that the river gate could not be contractually opened until construction was complete, and that unsanitary construction could not be considered complete.

Meanwhile, the cats went about their task with their characterisically elegant murderous gluttony, and the aqueduct was certified sanitary. However, the procurement department noted that stray cats were abundant and could have been procured for 1/10th the requested cost, so the reimbursement was denied. Because of that, the engineers refused to <open the river gates>.

Over the next two months, Eliza informed Akshay that the dispute had escalated. Procurement published a public RFP, distributed by letter on all merchant vessels doing business with any of the holdings of the Inlet Sea. <Waymo> an organization from Grivougne that many suspected was a front for the Many, submitted a public RFP. They would be sending a ship of their own consultants to inspect the existing aqueduct and suggest improvements.

Eliza arrived at the boat one morning, only two days after her last visit, while Akshay was still in the hold. He didn't notice her come aboard, and said, stupidly, "I don't have another <order ready>," when he saw her climbing down the ladder.

"Something's happening, Akshay," she said.

<...>

"Anyway," she concluded, "You should leave."

"What about you?"

She shrugged. "Family stays."

Akshay nodded. They looked at each other for a long moment, and then she left. Akshay took a deep breath.

<he heard more rumors at the [parlor]>

Several people claimed to have seen the entire Augur staff hurriedly exit the manor, and others said that a contingent of clerks had been locked in the university chapel. Had several prolonged failures in the aqueduct precipitated a confrontation? Or was it due to the recent publication of several particularly private letters written by Lord Wall's second daughter, and the subsequent street performances using them as source material?

Akshay could not bring himself to add the truth to the rumors: that it was all due to a herd of cats.

<preparing to leave>

Akshay planned to spend the night camping in the hills overlooking Wallanport. It was an excellent vantage point for watching traffic into and out of the city. The temperature was comfortable enough for sleeping outside, so he would not be too inconvenienced if the rumors turned out to be false.

Several hours before dawn, he discovered what an excellent vantage point it was for watching the lanterns of the Augur's ships as they appeared on the horizon and floated slowly across the Inlet Sea towards the city.

He could see very clearly when the docks went up in flames.

<It occurred to Akshay, as he listened to distant screams, that if the cause of the conflagration was the Augur's purported demand for a greater share of the city's revenue (as he had heard), then the docks were a poor target. Most of the ships berthed there were foreign traders, and a large percentage of Wallanport's wealth came from customs duty. Considering the additional fees from leasing the berths, it seemed a suspect long term monetization strategy.>

Then Akshay heard a dog barking, which made him sad, and this made him feel guilty because there were still humans screaming.

Feeling sick to his stomach, he gathered up his pack and bedroll and began walking. The hills to the west of Wallanport are a relatively small geographic feature, and by morning he had descended them. When he reached the road to Freehull, he stopped and ate a slice of bread and aged cheese. Then he kept walking.

<Wallanport benefitted from a warm, coastal wind, but on the other side of the hills. Things were different. Firs and spruces were abundant. Nevertheless, it was mid-summer, and even there the weather was good.>

<A large river approached the road and turned left to parallel it. Akshay ate another slice of bread and cheese with his feet in the water. He wondered about [Eliza|boat?]>

Akshay reached the clearing that marked the edge of Lord Wall's holdings just as the sun began to set. In the middle of the clearing was a sign for Freehull. Freehull, as far as the Wallanporters were concerned, was little more than a large tract of trees with a small estate somewhere in the middle. For at least two decades, it had been administered by a woman who called herself Founder May, and despite its proximity, there was very little trade between Wallanport and her estate.

There were twenty or so people already in the clearing, clustered around two cook fires. Akshay introduced himself to a few of them and learned that they were nearly all professionals and artisans who had fled Wallanport before the Augur laid siege. Like Akshay, each of them was friendly with at least one of Lord Wall's many relatives, so rumors of the broken treaty had reached them before the gates closed.

The night was warm, and most of the travellers were well stocked with food, so bartering was brisk and convivial. There was much talk about politics and none about death.

The next morning some of the others continued onwards, but Akshay stayed in the camp. He had never been to Freehull before, and he wanted to wait for news from Wallanport. He spent several hours being talked to by a barrister named Margaret.

Margaret talked conspiratorially about what the other Wallanporters must be running from. Akshay thought that was obvious: a city on fire. But she never gave him the chance to express this thought, or even to excuse himself. So he wandered off mid-conversation to fetch more firewood, and when he returned she picked up where she had left off. While he re-organized his pack and washed his spare tunic in the river, she mulled over hypotheses about the cause of the Augur's attack.

Eventually, she switched topics, and he learned that she had served as general counsel for the procurement department during the cat herding incident.

"And do you know what the worst part of it was?" she said. "We decided to depose the cats, to prove that a cat is a cat is a cat and that the cats they bought were no different than a common stray. So I have to go to one of the construction site -- why the clerks couldn't catch one themselves is beyond me -- and you would be shocked by the conditions there. The footing is appaling and it's terribly hard to breathe with all the dust in the air.

"Anyway, there we were, trying to lure the cats out of unfinished sections of aqueduct with goat milk and dead rats. Believe me when I tell you that those cats really are spirit animals, and not the good kind of spirit, either. We'd drop a rat down on a line and wait, and nothing, and then just when we'd started to nod off, the bait would be gone!"

Akshay was no longer pretending to re-organize his pack. He just stared at her, eyebrows raised, and mouth slightly agape.

"Then, after a day and a half of this, you won't believe it -- Eliza Wall showed up," continued Margaret. "And she started spouting off about the absurdity of trying to depose a cat. I still can't believe her nerve. You've heard of her, of course. She spends two out of every three weeks abroad, shooting twigs at a piece of paper in the woods, and then pretends to understand how to properly handle a forced arbitration!"

<Complain about Eliza with the head of the rangers. Something Lady Brett-ish.>

Akshay suddenly needed to fetch more firewood. Margaret followed him into the trees, still complaining about Lady Eliza. Akshay detoured inconveniently under and around branches, and eventually heard her gasp as one snapped back at her. She grumbled loudly about the offensiveness of nature and wandered off.

Akshay returned with an armful of dead wood and set it down near one of the cook fires. A trio of muralists were debating whose art was most likely to survive the siege, and Akshay feigned interest. He liberally shared his salted <snack food>, and so spent the rest of the day with one of them on either side. He caught an occasional glimpse of Margaret hovering behind them, but none of them acknowledged her.

In the evening, two teenagers, a brother and sister, arrived from Wallanport. They said that the fire had spread and the aqueduct had been sabotaged. This was unsurprising, concluded the others, and Lord Wall would probably sue for peace. His only alternative was to hire a mercenary arms and repair division from the Independent Nation of Orsland, but the amount of time for messengers to even reach the I.N.O. could be prohibitive.

This discussion continued for several minutes until the sister quietly interrupted and asked if they might have something to eat.

There were no more arrivals from Wallanport for the next three days, at which point they calculated that the city was out of fresh water. Margaret, the barrister, rallied a party to go back to investigate. She and three others began bartering for extra travel rations, taking special care to note the danger and uncertainty they would be facing. To avoid them, Akshay spent the morning and most of the afternoon in the surrounding forest.

<more forest details -- no coppices because it's a coniferous>

Margaret's party had not departed when Akshay returned to the camp. They didn't leave on the next day either, and Akshay suspected that they had consumed all of their extra travelling food by the following day, when a tall man walked out of the forest.

---

The teenage sister spotted him while he was still under the trees. He was tall and slender, with a pronounced limp, coming in and out of sight as he passed behind thick <fir> trees. He continued several paces into the clearing before he stopped and frowned at the disorderly camp.

The man had come from roughly the same direction that Akshay had explored, and Akshay had not noticed any trails or other signs of human disturbance. But the man was well dressed, wearing a freshly pressed tunic and burgundy neck tie under a cape that stretched just past his waist. His boots flared stylishly at the knee. Given the attire and his pronounced limp, Akshay did not think that he had travelled very far.

The man continued to frown at the camp, then sighed and tried to smile pleasantly. Then he said, "Now that your seven day land use trial has ended, who intends to continue in our extended residence program?"

After a brief silence, the man said in a tired voice, "As you know, Freehull considers property to be a public commodity, and welcomes visitors to reside where they please for up to seven days. After that, extended residence costs one half-mark per week, to be presented bimonthly at the Freehull Estate Administration Center. Any additional non-land usage has an additional surcharge, as you would expect."

None of the Wallanporters replied. The man looked around, exasperated. "Seriously, people?"

He stalked unevenly to the carved wooden sign that read "Freehull". The sign was in the middle of the clearing, loosely at the center of the camp. Victoria, a stocky woman who sourced animal parts for apothecaries, was sitting on her bedroll immediately in front of it. The man stopped and glared down at her.

"As you would expect," he said to them all, "If you had bothered to read the terms of the land you are now in." To Victoria, he said, "While you are entitled to reside where you please when in Freehull," and he closed his eyes, "Would you please move yourself from the _specific_ piece of land on which you are now residing."

"What?" she said. "Why?"

"Oh, come on," he said, opening his eyes. "For a minute."

She hesitated before standing and stepping to the side of her bedroll. The man kicked it aside. Several of the Wallanporters grumbled, but the man ignored them and started kicking at the dirt in front of the sign. He soon unearthed a small box.

"Would you please pick that up for me?" he said to Victoria.

"No," she replied.

He glared at her, huffed, and carefully kneeled down to pick it up. After shaking off more dirt, he opened the box and pulled out a parchment. He unrolled this and read aloud: "Welcome to Freehull. Visitors are entitled to seven days residence on any uncontested property, after which they will be charged one half-mark per week... and it goes on."

He looked around and added, "As you would expect."

"I wouldn't expect that," said Margaret loudly. He was seated at the back of the camp, with his feet tucked under him.

"Why not? Are you daft?"

"No, but I would expect all regulations to be posted clearly in an accessible location --"

The man interrupted and gestured to the box, "What was inaccessible about that?"

"It was buried underground!" exclaimed Margaret. "Under most established regional common law, regulations in an underground box would not be considered clear or accessible. They should be posted in plain sight on walls or --"

"Do you see any walls here?" scoffed the man. "We understand that you have your laws. Different land, different laws. We understand this, so we make our terms immediately accessible to all travelers who enter our borders. Look at the arrow on the Freehull sign. It is very clearly pointing down, in commonly understood vernacular, to where one can find all relevant terms and conditions."

"I thought that was pointing in the direction of Freehull," said Victoria.

The man looked at her, dumbfounded. "You thought that Freehull was... underground?"

"No, I thought the arrow meant it was straight ahead and that someone had just carved it upside down."

"You thought..." The man shook his head in disbelief. He continued to shake his head as he put the scroll back into the box and the box back into the hole. He slowly got to his feet and kicked some dirt over the box, saying, "Your extended residence fees are due at the Estate Administration Center at the end of the month. Your initial billing period will be pro-rated, as you would expect."

Then he began limping back towards the trees.

"Where's the Administration Center?" someone called after him.

"Down the road," he said, without looking back. "If you leave within the hour, you can make it before the inn closes, although not before the Center itself closes."

"Then where you are going?"

"Back the way I came, as you would expect. Honestly, you people..."

Suddenly, Margaret yelled, "But I'm not even in Freehull!"

The man stopped at that and turned, saying angrily, "I do not know how visitors are received in Lord Wall's land, but I find that bad jokes from guests I have only recently met are usually made in very poor taste."

"Well, I'm still on Lord Wall's side of that sign. You don't presume to apply your laws to his land as well, do you?"

"This entire clearing is part of Freehull," said the man, speaking slowly. "We cannot place a sign at the very _edge_ of our territory, because that would imply placing our regulation box in the _adjacent_ territory." He continued at a faster, angrier clip, saying, "This is all defined very clearly in the appendices referenced by the fourth paragraph in the terms in the box, which you are welcome to dig back up at your own convenience."

"Where are these appendices? Up at the top of one of those trees?" asked Margaret. "I need to see them in their entirety before I can evaluate the veracity of your claims."

"There are copies available in the Administration Center," said the man, and he limped off into the forest.

No one said anything until he was out of sight, at which point they heard him shout, "As you would expect!"
