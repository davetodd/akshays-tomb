"The nerve!" said Malcolm.

"We should kill him," said the teenage brother.

"We can't do that!" said <...>.

"Yes we can. Look at that limp. We could catch him easily."

"I mean, I know we can, but we shouldn't."

"Why not?"

"Someone else is coming," said the teenage sister.

Talking ceased as the refugees lookied in the direction she indicated. A man was coming down the road from Freehull, only he wasn't walking, he was riding something, kicking regularly at the ground in a way that seemed to be propelling him forward. The contraption has two wheels, one in the front and one in the back, and a [frame|shaft|front] that extended up to a pair of handle bars that he was gripping.

He scooted right into the middle of their camp, to the Freehull sign, before stopping.

"I apologize for interrupting," he said, without hint of apology. "But you look like travellers."

No one answered.

"Now, believe me, I know what the problem is. You've travelled a long way, but the going is slow, your packs are heavy, and your feet are tired."

"Actually," said Malcolm, apparently spoiling for an argument after the unsatisfactory conclusion with the limping man from Freehull. "We've been camped here for <three days>. And Wallanport is only a day away."

Malcolm glared.

"But what if there was another way?" he said, ignoring this exchange.

I hear there are mountains.

"Yes, just leave it wherever, and these gentlemen will come and pick it up." The closest fat man nodded. The one in the back cringed, and then promptly started to rub his chin with his thumb, as if the cringe had been meant solely to initiate that motion. The other two were impassive.

"Really?" said the teenager. "Can I try it?"

"Absolutely," said the man, with an expansive sweep of his arm.

Pinched the bridge of his nose.
Sucked air through his teeth.
Nostrils flared.
Bit his upper lip/lower lip.
Put his thumb and middle finger to his temples/eyes.
Patted the dog on the head.
Frowned? With one side of his mouth.

"We're hoping it plagues," he said with a sigh.

"What?" asked Malcolm.

"You know, spreads of its own accord, via word of mouth."

"What does that have to do with the plague?"

"Well, you know how when one person gets the plague, everyone else in the neighborhood has it by the end of the week?"

"That sounds awful!" said Victoria.

...

"What's a virus? How would

The freehull guy is from the waterfall. What's the waterfall? It's a place where water falls. I didn't know you meant it literally.

"Look how agile those scooters are!"

... The Wallanport rangers on scooters.
