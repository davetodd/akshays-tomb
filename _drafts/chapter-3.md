"We should kill him," said the teenage brother.

"What? Why?"

"Look at that limp. We could catch him easily."

"We can't do that!" said <...>.

"Yes we can," he pointed at Akshay. "That one's been making arrows. Probably has a bow with him."

"I don't," said Akshay.

The teenager looked skeptical. "He's slow and we outnumber him. We could knock him out with any of these staves and then throw him in the river."

"But why would we want to?"

"Because < >".

"< >.

"Someone else is coming," said the teenage sister.

Talking ceased as the refugees lookied in the direction she indicated. A man was coming down the road from Freehull, only he wasn't walking, he was riding something, kicking regularly at the ground in a way that seemed to be propelling him forward. The contraption has two wheels, one in the front and one in the back, and a [frame|shaft|front] that extended up to a pair of handle bars that he was gripping.

He scooted right into the middle of their camp, to the Freehull sign, before stopping.

"I apologize for interrupting," he said, without hint of apology. "But you look like travellers."

No one answered.

"Now, believe me, I know what the problem is. You've travelled a long way, but the going is slow, your packs are heavy, and your feet are tired."

"Actually," said Margaret, still spoiling for an argument after the unsatisfactory conclusion with the limping man from Freehull. "We've been camped here for <three days>. And Wallanport is only a day away."

"Yes, even the thought of continuing on is a tiring one." He nodded sagely.

"Yes," said the teenage brother, pointing at Margaret. "She was going to go back to Wallanport yesterday, but the thought of that was so tiring that she ate an extra helping of all the things."

Margaret glared.

"But what if there was another way?" he said, ignoring this exchange.

"You mean that thing?" said Akshay, pointed at the contraption.

The man grinned. "Precisely."

"We're establishing a post. Just leave it anywhere outside the next town and pick up another on your way out."

"Why wouldn't I keep the same one?"

"Well, these are great for travel, but not for sight seeing. Anyway there are regulations..."

"How'd you manage to get them banned.

He sucked in air through his teeth.

< >

"Really?" said the teenage brother. "Can I try it?"

"Absolutely," said the man, with an expansive sweep of his arm.

The teenager took the handlebars from the man, and put a foot on the base. He twisted the handlebars back and forth, and then kicked off -- straight towards the river. He didn't stop until he hit the water, at which point he jumped off, splashed back to shore, and watched as the scooter started to float away.

The man gaped.

"Sorry," said the brother, "I didn't know how to steer."

"The hell you didn't!"

"Hey, at least he didn't kill you," said X.

"What? Why would he want to do that?"

"He wanted to kill the other man."

"Which other man."

He furrowed his brow. The limping man. That bastard. He's from the waterfall.

"We should go," said the sister, quietly, to her brother. As the conversation continued, Akshay watched as the teenagers stole to the back of the group. He brother grabbed Margaret's pack and hoisted it to his shoulders. Then they hurried down the road towards Freehull.

The freehull guy is from the waterfall. What's the waterfall? It's a place where water falls. I didn't know you meant it literally.

Margaret had noticed that her pack was missing.

...

The man threw up his arms. I only made one.

"I'll go with you," said Akshay.
