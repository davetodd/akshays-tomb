"We should kill him," said the teenage brother.

"We can't do that!" said <...>.

"Yes we can. Look at that limp. We could catch him easily."

"I mean, I know we can, but we shouldn't."

"Why not?"

"There's someone else in the trees," said the teenage sister.

Everyone in the camp looked in the direction she indicated. It was quiet.

And a different man stepped into the clearing with a sheepish grin.

"I apologize for interrupting," he said. "But you look like travellers." He snapped his fingers.

Nothing happened.

He snapped his fingers again. The Wallanporters watched him silently. He frowned and looked back into the trees.

There were also, Akshay saw, several other figures hurrying through the trees. As they reached the edge of the clearing, he counted four of them. Unlike the tall man, they carried packs, and they were uniformly plump and out of breath.

Finally, there was a commotion in the brush, and soon four fat men could be seen maneuvering large packs between the trees. One man stopped and put his hands on his knees. Another, whose pack extended well above his head, caught it on a tree branch and knocked himself to the ground. The other two made it into the clearing, and as soon as they had, the first man said.

"Now, I know what your problem is. You've travelled a long way, but the going is slow, and it's tiring."

"Actually," said Malcolm, apparently spoiling for an argument after the unsatisfactory conclusion with the limping man from Freehull. "We've been camped here for <three days>. And Wallanport is only a day away."

"Yes, you've been camped here because of how tiring the thought is of travelling on foot another day."

"Yes," said the teenage brother, pointing at Malcolm. "She was going to go back to Wallanport yesterday, but the thought of that was so tiring that he ate an extra helping of all the things."

Malcolm glared.

"Yes, just leave it wherever, and these gentlemen will come and pick it up." The closest fat man nodded. The one in the back cringed, and then promptly started to rub his chin with his thumb, as if the cringe had been meant solely to initiate that motion. The other two were impassive.

"Really?" said the teenager. "Can I try it?"

"Absolutely," said the man, with an expansive sweep of his arm.

Pinched the bridge of his nose.
Sucked air through his teeth.
Nostrils flared.
Bit his upper lip/lower lip.
Put his thumb and middle finger to his temples/eyes.
Patted the dog on the head.
Frowned? With one side of his mouth.

"We're hoping it plagues," he said with a sigh.

"What?" asked Malcolm.

"You know, spreads of its own accord, via word of mouth."

"What does that have to do with the plague?"

"Well, you know how when one person gets the plague, everyone else in the neighborhood has it by the end of the week?"

"That sounds awful!" said Victoria.

The freehull guy is from the waterfall. What's the waterfall? It's a place where water falls. I didn't know you meant it literally.

"Look how agile those scooters are!"
