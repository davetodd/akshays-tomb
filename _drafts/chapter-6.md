"We should kill him," said the teenage brother.

"What? Why?" said <an incredulous X>.

"Look at that limp. We could catch him easily."

"We can't do that!" said <...>.

"Yes we can," he pointed at Akshay. "That one's been making arrows. Probably has a bow with him."

"I don't," said Akshay.

The teenager looked skeptical. "Anyway, he's slow and we outnumber him. We could knock him out with any of these <staves> and then throw him in the river."

"But why would we want to do that?"

"Because he's crazy and wants to imprison us here."

"What? How do you end up with that?"

"The boy's right," said Margaret. "'Non-land usage has an additional surcharge,'" she quoted. "That could mean anything! Obviously, this entire holding is just a large debtor's prison. As for the crazy -- normal people don't come limping out of the forest with polished boots. Normal people walk on the road--"

"Someone is coming," interrupted the teenage sister.

Talking ceased as the refugees looked in the direction she indicated. A man was coming down the road from Freehull. He was standing on something, kicking regularly at the ground in a way that seemed to propel the thing forward. The contraption has two wheels, one in the front and one in the back, and a [frame|shaft|front] that extended up to a pair of handle bars that he was gripping.

<picture of man on scooter>

He scooted right into the middle of their camp, all the way to the Freehull sign, before stopping. <He kept one foot on the contraption.>

"I apologize for interrupting," he said, without hint of apology. "But you look like travellers."

No one answered.

"Now, believe me, I know what the problem is. You've travelled a long way, but the going is slow, your packs are heavy, and your feet are tired."

"Actually," said Margaret, obviously spoiling for an argument. "We've been camped here for <three days>. And Wallanport is only a day's hike that way."

He nodded sagely. "And the thought of going back is too exhausting to contemplate."

"Yes," said the teenage brother, pointing at Margaret. "She was going to go back to Wallanport yesterday, but the thought of that was so tiring that she ate an extra helping of <all the things>."

Margaret glared at him.

"But what if there was another way?" he said, ignoring this exchange. He spread his arms expansively, raised his eyebrows several times in quick succession, and nodded his chin towards the contraption that he was balancing one foot on.

No one <took the bait>. The man raised his eyebrows several more times and looked around expectantly.

Akshay sighed inwardly -- <felt the exhalation through his nostrils>. He wanted to say something snide to Margaret: "What's that you were saying about normal people walking down the road?" But instead he pointed at the contraption and said, "You mean that thing?"

The man grinned. "Precisely."

When the man did not elaborate, Akshay said, "What is it?"

"We call them scooters."

"I only see one of it, and one of you," said Margaret.

"Fear not! <This is a prototype.>"

"We're establishing a post. You just leave it anywhere outside the next town and pick up any ones that you find on your way out."

"Why wouldn't I just use the same one the whole way?"

"Well, these are designed for travelling across holdings, not through towns. There are a few minor regulations to be aware of if you're considering using them in town, so we recommend just hopping off before you're observed, and..."

"You mean you got these banned in towns? How'd you do that? These aren't wheeled, wooden <alpacas>, are they?" <Alpacas are banned in towns because of their tendency to bite people and steal sandwiches.>

The man sucked in air through his teeth.

< >

"So can I try it?" said the teenage brother.

"Absolutely!" said the man.

The man stepped off it and held the handlebars towards the teenager. The latter put a foot on its base, twisted the handlebars back and forth, and then kicked off -- straight towards the river. He didn't stop until he was knee deep in the water, at which point he jumped off, splashed back to shore, and watched as the scooter started to float away.

The man gaped.

"Sorry," said the brother, "I didn't know how to steer."

"The <hell> you didn't!"

"At least he didn't kill you," said X.

"What? Why would he want to do that?"

"He wanted to kill the other man."

"Which other man?"

"The one from Freehull. Nice clothes. Walks with a limp. He came from that way." <Points to the forest.>

The man <furrowed his brows>. "I know that <bastard>. He's the one who got these things banned."

Meanwhile, Akshay watched the two teenagers. Instead of returning to the group, which had all eyes on the scooting man, the brother had walked towards some of the gear. The sister <slunk> away towards him. Akshay watched the brother grab Margaret's pack and hoist it to his shoulders. Then the two of them hurried down the road towards Freehull.

<more converation>

" <Why?> That's where his limp comes from!."

Margaret had noticed that her pack was missing.

...

The man threw up his arms. I only made one.

...

"I'll go with you," said Akshay.
