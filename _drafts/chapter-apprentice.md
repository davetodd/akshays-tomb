It was early in Wallanport, and the coastal air was thick and humid and still. Cold, too, since the morning chill had not yet retreated back to the hills.

Akshay waited outside of what he hoped was the correct building, alternately squatting and standing, breathing on his hands to keep them warm. He watched the silhouette of a stone crane land on a roof across the street. The bird would perch there, statuesque, until the cool, evening wind rolled down from the western hills and blew it and the humidity out to sea.

Other stone cranes circled the city in languid, solitary loops. Akshay heard them calling, though he was never sure who they were calling to -- there were such long silences between their cries.

A commotion inside the building distracted him. It sounded like someone had knocked over a stack of wood. There was muffled cursing, and then a small thump at routine intervals, as the wood was presumably restacked.

Akshay stood in a loading alley behind the buildings on Mule Street. They were shops, mostly, with their back entrances nearly a meter above street level so that delivery carts could be backed up to them. An assortment of planks and upside down wooden crates were arranged throughout the alley as makeshift stairs. The entrance in front of Akshay looked like it was designed for a sliding door, like a barn's, except that there was no track for a door to slide along. Instead, a large, unfinished rectangle of wood was held in place by a metal chained that was padlocked to hooks on either side of the entrance.

Akshay knocked on the <door>. The noise from inside ceased. He waited. He squeezed his cold hands together, then released them and watched the blood return to the white spots made by his fingers. A stone crane called out in the distance, and Akshay heard the squawking of a pair of chimney finches somewhere down the street. The building remained silent.

After a few minutes, Akshay began hopping up and down on the wooden crate in front of the entrance. He did this on one foot at a time; ten hops on his left foot, then ten with his right. Then repeat. After several sets of this, he finally felt warmer, and after a few more minutes, a woman turned into the alley and walked towards him.

"You're the apprentice," she said.

"Yes. My name is Akshay. Here are my papers." He pulled a <stack> of papers from the pocket of his trousers. The papers were folded neatly down the middle, with the stamp of the Augur's immigration department half visible on the back of the uppermost paper.

The woman narrowed her eyes. "What are those for?"

"They must be made available as evidence of my employment upon request," he recited. It had taken him seventeen days to obtain of them, and he had endured numerous lectures from officious contractors in immigration and historical artifacts (a miscommunication had nearly led to Akshay's enrollment on a university-sponsored archaeological quest). <The foreign contractors were the worst.> They seemed barely able to conceal the certainty with which they knew that Akshay would inevitably run afoul of the process and ruin it for all of them.

"Well, I don't have anywhere to put them. Give them to Godwin."

"Who's that?"

"My fletcher. He lives inside. Does he know you're here?"

"I don't know -- I thought I heard someone inside so I knocked, but I haven't heard anyone since."

"Ah. That's too bad."

"Why?"

The woman smiled. She walked to the side of the entrance and reached up to the padlock that attached the chain to the wall.

"Hold on to the door," she said.

Akshay put two hands on the large rectangle of wood. He still held his papers in his right hand, so he positioned the knuckles of this hand against the door. The woman unlocked the padlock and let the chain fall and Akshay felt a sudden weight as the door tipped on to him. He grunted, lost his balance, and fell backwards, the unchained, unattached door on top of him.

"I said _hold_ it," said the woman, as Akshay dragged himself out from underneath it. "Prop it up over there." She gestured to the side of the entrance. "And then come on in." Akshay lifted up the door and positioned it next to the entrance. Then he climbed into the building.

"My name is Judith," she said, as he got to his feet. "And this is Godwin." A man was crouching behind a pile of wood behind the stove in the center of the room. He held a drawn bow, arrow knocked and aimed at Akshay.

"Is this the one what I heard thieving around?" said Godwin. "I was up to start the stove, and I hear hammering at the chain on the door. Coming to thieve our <designs>, I shouldn't wonder!"

"Godwin," said Judith. "Meet the new apprentice."

"I have papers," said Akshay, nodding his head sideways to the papers that he held in an outstretched hand.

"Papers!" cried Godwin. He released the string. Akshay heard the snap of the string at the same moment that he felt the papers rip free from his hand. He looked back in astonishment to see the papers pinned to the wall by an arrow, just to the right of the opening on to the alley. Then another arrow impaled the papers and Akshay spun back to see Godwin rapidly drawing a third arrow.

"Enough!" said Judith.

"What was that far?" asked Akshay, mouth agape.

"Papers," muttered Godwin. He set down the bow and began to stacking the wood <that Akshay now noticed was strewn about the room>.

"Never mind," said Judith. "Welcome to my shop."

They are sitting in the grass, just above the edge of the shadow that is receding down the hill. The grass is dry, but the soil underneath is wet, and he feels it soaking into his <jeans>.

She sees that he is looking at her, so she sticks her tongue out and swings a lazy fist at his arm.

---

Godwin sat cross-legged on a stool, elbows on the table in front of him. Miniature bows were piled on one side of the table, and he held the ends of another in between two fingers. He alternated bending it and carving thin strips of wood from it with the knife in his other hand.

---

"Akshay, is it? Listen. This city is drowning in paper. Did you know that imports of wood pulp accounted for over <two fifths of something> last quarter?"

"I did not know that. That is most interesting. Are those statistics available to any interested reader? I would be interested --"

"No, they're not. It took me five months to get a business permit for this place, and I'll be damed if I touch another piece of parchment. We're making archery here, Akshay."

"Yes, arrows, bows. I have some experience with these. From Grivougne, where my uncle sponsored my application. You can see in the fourth parchment -- it is marked 1001.4, and it describes my previous employment --"

---

"No, archery. <We're bringing it back.>"

She opened the door. <...>

<She gives him arrows to give out.>

<He goes to the docks and gives them all out there.>

<Judith is kind of annoyed that he's back so fast and that he gave them all to the sharkers, and so fast.>

<He goes home. The next morning he meets the many loitering outside of his apartment. Tells Judith about it, she thinks they're dangerous.>

Another woman enters the shop. Eliza. Judith has sponsored her. Judith volunteers Akshay as a "caddy?"

<Some other startup type thing.>

An incident with the Augur.

<At tournament #2. Judith drops sponsorship because nobles will be pissed that a commoner won and will do everything to shut her down. And so Brennon sponsors her.>

Paper crane man.
The guard at the bank.
Acquisition.

The recruit at the bank wants a war because he's just so bored shitless. Won't pass along their message.
They finally get a message to the bank?

Lord Wall (has little power and little money -- just a figurehead)
-- the rangers
-- the knight

The Bank (has the money)
-- do they have the Augur's money?

The Augur (has the power)
-- they want control / power more than money
-- Akshay + Eliza bring them a deal that offers more money but they choose control
-- they learn this from discussions with a consultant from bankruptcy?
-- they can attempt to crack down on Lord Wall, but find that the bank has all the money, so the bank ends up declaring war?

The Many -- want personal details. Conducting a census. Knowing as much as they can know. Bringing humanitarian aid.
-- they recruit Akshay + Eliza to spy?

---

Akshay flexed his fingers as he looked at the back of his hand.
