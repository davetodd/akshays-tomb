It was early in Wallanport, and the coastal air was thick and humid and still. Cold, too, since the morning chill had not yet retreated back to the hills.

Akshay waited outside the archery shop where he worked, alternately squatting and standing, breathing on his hands to keep them warm. He watched the silhouette of a stone crane land on a roof across the street. The bird would perch there, statuesque, until the cool, evening wind rolled down from the western hills and blew it and the humidity out to sea.

Other stone cranes circled the city in languid, solitary loops. Akshay heard them calling, though he was never sure who they were calling to -- there were such long silences between their cries.

Inside the shop, he heard Godwin, the old fletcher, stacking wood by the stove. The man slept in the shop, in the back corner with the goose fletchings. Akshay did not know why Judith let him stay there, other than maybe as an excuse to not pay him.

Akshay, meanwhile, lived in small, shared apartment between the city's outer wall and its sprawling port. He had to leave well before dawn if he wanted to get through security at the outer gates before <traffic backed up>, so he usually arived at the shop before Judith. <He preferred waiting with the stone crane than with the other workers.>

<Like most of Wallanport's working population, Akshay lived outside the gates, between the outer wall and the sprawling port that connected the city to the Inlet Sea. He made sure to get to the quarter-gate well before dawn, before the officious morning security shift had come to post, and before the stone cranes had settled to the roofs.>

As for the gate traffic: Wallanport had two walls, an inner wall that surrounded Lord Wall's manor and an outer wall that surrounded most of the city's <commercial> district. The archery shop was in the latter district, between the two walls, or colloquially: "through the gate". There were twelve gates in the outer wall, laid out like a clock. Work permits were required to pass through any of them. Ever since gate security had been out-sourced to the Augur, the permits where thoroughly vetted, and traffic started to back up even before dawn. It could take an hour to get through on a busy day. Rumor held that the Augur was creating the slowdowns intentionally in order to justify bringing on more staff, but the only new staff that ever came on seemed to be for "line security" to prevent fights from breaking out among impatient workers.

<While he waited, he played games to keep warm: hopping on one leg up and down the crates that led to the front door, running little sprints back and forth between the archery shop and the adjacent <paper> shop. And he acquainted himself with the crane that perched on the opposite roof. It resolutely ignored him, but at least it did not seem to resent him. Akshay appreciated that. Their shared presence was not a hardship, though they could do nothing for one another.>

<Unlike Godwin, who could have just opened the back door.>

Every morning for the first two months of his apprenticeship, he had banged on the shop's back door, imploring Godwin to let him in. He stopped trying after Godwin started shooting at him. Or rather, after Godwin started shooting arrows into the door. The first arrow appeared in the same spot that Akshay had just hit with his fist. It was a live arrow, with a <bodkin> point, not just something used for practice. The point jutted far enough out of the wooden door to have severed <the tissue in his thumb> .

Horrified, Akshay banged on the door again. Another arrow appeared as his fist left the door. He slammed the door with his other hand and an arrow followed it. He blinked, waited, stood there with raised fist. Nothing. So he pounded on the door in a slow circle, and the arrows followed his fist.

A few minutes later, Judith let them in through the front entrance. Godwin sat in the back corner, carving a nock in the shaft of an arrow. He was grinning, and Akshay could see the gums above his rotten teeth. Judith glanced at the perfect circle of arrows in the back door and hummed to herself. <Why doesn't she just give Akshay a key? Apprenticeship by-laws?>

---

"Don't get here so early," said Judith, as she unlocked the chain that held the shop's front door in place.

"Gate traffic," said Akshay.

"And wear a coat."

"I won't want it when I'm walking home."

This was their morning routine. After Judith <coiled up the chain>, Akshay picked up the door. The shop's front entrance had no hinges. It was designed for a sliding door, like a barn's, but there was no track for a door to slide along. It was also elevated above the street, but no porch, landing, or stairs had ever been built. Instead, two crates were weighted with scrap wood, turned upside down, and used as steps. Every morning after Judith unlocked the door, Akshay had to carry it down the false steps and prop it up against the wall.

"You have the shop this morning," said Judith.

"Oh?" said Akshay.

"Board meeting today. In the manor."

"Wasn't that supposed to be last week?"

"It was. This is new. I got a note about it from Bretton last night. Apparently procurement just got back from their vision quest."

"Their what?"

"I didn't tell you about that? They filed an official quest with the Augur's historical bureau. To seek out their core competencies and better align that with their mission. They sailed to ÃŽles de Maurgarite last week."

"That's off the coast of Grivougne."

"Yes, it has those two lantern-lit, fully-catered golf courses."

"What does that have to do with an emergency board meeting?"

"Bretton didn't say it was an emergency. Just that there were concerns. I don't know. See that you finish <the order for Eliza>."

<IF I'M BORED WRITING THE FOLLOWING, IT'S PROBABLY BORING READING.>

The shop had a wood stove in the center, which they used to heat and bend bow staves and arrow shafts. Judith and Akshay worked on opposite sides of it, Judith with her back to the entrance. In the winter, the cold wind from the western hills sometimes lingered through the day, but even then the situation with the door was not much of a problem. Akshay just dragged his work bench closer to the stove. Godwin insulated himself with goose feathers -- Akshay had actually seen him stuffing them down his shirt -- and then spent the next few hours removing them in sets of threes to use as arrow fletchings.

Godwin did his fletching work in the back corner, sitting on the floor, hunched over and cross legged. If he ran out of equipment, he barked at Akshay, who had to scramble to identify and replace whatever was missing. Akshay had gotten pretty good at project management as a result. He needed to know what they were all working on in order to know what Godwin. <It was a system that worked well, until procurement got involved.>

One of Akshay's responsibilities was to nod to Judith if a customer entered the shop who was worth her attention. Judith owned the shop. She was a former field archer who competed professionally in the tournament circuit that rotated through the holdings of the Inlet Sea. After retiring, she had founded the shop in order to produce a new kind of recurve bow, one with interchangeable limbs that could be detached from the riser (the center of the bow).

Judith preferred bows to people. Some of them she had to talk to, if they had enough money that they absolutely couldn't be ignored. The rest were Akshay's responsibility. She had taken Akshay on as an apprentice because he could read and write, so he took all the orders that did not absolutely require her. Not that there were many of these. Bows hadn't grown in popularity because equipment is prestige. While they increased the flexibility of the archer, most participants were wealthy enough to just have a full set of bows. That's why they had caddies. <Godwin had been a bow caddie.>

People had been an issue for Judith on the tournament circuit as well. There was a story that she had lost her first and only arrow sponsor after intentionally snapping two sheaves of arrows in the semifinals of the Port Crown, Wallanport's summer tournament. She had struggled in the quarterfinals the afternoon before, barely securing the last spot into semis, so she took an extra long practice session that evening, <and lost most of her arrows>.

She hadn't read anything about contractual arrow limits in the sponsorship terms, so she arrived early to their tent the next morning. They didn't have any arrows, but they didn't want to cause a PR issue. A runner was sent and arrived with two sheaves of arrows just moments before her turn. She pulled out one arrow literally for the first time while still in the stadium -- the course would wind down to <somewhere> but for now the people could see her. And the arrow was the incorrect spine. Not enough that it would risk shattering, but regardless. She snapped each arrow in front of the entire crowd. By the time she made it back to the staging area, the sponsor had already submitted paperwork for breach of contract.

<Combine the Judith description with Akshay's letter to his mother?>

Akshay worked at his bench, planing square dowels of cedar into cylindrical arrow shafts. He was composing a letter to his mother in his head. She lived in Grivougne, a holding across the Inlet Sea. His uncle had secured this apprenticeship for Akshay's fourteenth birthday, and Akshay had not seen either of them since emigrating. But he still wrote.

Stable, satisfying work. He spent the first weeks of his apprenticeship shadowing Godwin, dreading both the man and the monotony of what awaited him. Now, five years later, it was easier to imagine five years turning into fifteen or twenty years. He enjoying planing shafts and tillering bows and he had the time to do it well. Judith was not warm, and Godwin was barely civil, but they nodded their approval when they liked his work. Five years in, that nod was no longer such a rarity.

Akshay would earn his professional certification in another year and then he was free to do whatever he liked. As long as it had something to do with archery. So he would probably stay here, since he did not have the money to start his own shop, and anyway, how many archery shops could one city support?

Probably quite a few, actually, but he had already written a letter about that. There had not been a border war in eight years, and the archery tournament circuit that rotated through the holdings of the Inlet Sea was <extremely popular>. The craftsmanship required for a tournament contestant was significantly higher than what was required for an army, and the <field> was only beginning to grasp the scope of innovation that awaited it.

Akshay had a few ideas of his own -- but he had written a letter about that too. He wondered if his mother cared about the ideas, or if she was just happy that he wrote, or if she even cared that he did.

---

He heard footsteps on the crates outside the entrance and looked up, expecting Judith.

Instead, a woman entered into the shop, and a man followed, and they were apparently mid-argument. It was very sudden. There was no door to open. The woman was holding a keyogi in her arms -- a small, bear shaped animal that walked on all fours. Akshay did not trust the things. They lived on roofs, and he had heard that they ate stone crane eggs.

"Honestly, Eliza," the man said. "You're overreacting."

"Honestly, Bretton," said the woman, "That was the most predictable thing you could've said." To the room, she said, as if in accusation: "This is the last independent shop in Wallanport, isn't it?"

"The last independent what?" said Akshay.

"Bretton has just sold his share in Rampart Bows to the Augur's <> division. They produce all of their arrows in Ternfelden and have them shipped and they're shit and there's no way to get custom work done. And now they own every damn shop in Wallanport except this one, which I'd never have heard about except that my uncle works in procurement so I know you can at least make military shit. Shit! What a shit. Do you do custom work, or just the standard fire ten arrows hope one sticks military shit?"

Without waiting for an answer, she turned on Bretton, the keyogi outstretched in front of her. It was chattering, making a fast paced clicking sound.

"What the hell did you think I was going to think? This is wonderful, Bretton, just wonderful. You're wonderful. I'm so impressed. Your financial acumen is unparalleled. You're a fucking idiot. This is why you don't win a fucking thing because all the equipment you ever use is shit. I'm declining my sponsorship. Tell Rampart to fuck himself. Better yet, fuck him yourself."

<PICK UP HERE>

She's actually pissed because of something with the Keyogi.

Judith comes back midway through this.

---

<Lead into this with Eliza noticing the crane?>

Judith never seemed to notice the cold. She also ignored the stone crane that perched across the street, no matter how many mornings Akshay pointed it out. This annoyed him, and it annoyed him that he was annoyed by it. Sometimes, with no conversation to interrupt his thoughts, he stewed on it for entire days. The crane ought to be their patron, he thought. But he thought that he did not seriously think that, so why did it matter?

---

The contract is now contingent on an agile consultant?

---

Something else. Procurement has hired an agile team?

---

Eliza visits again.

---

How do I get from there to killing Bretton? Or to the consultants?

---

Eliza walks in, holding a keyogi. I was giving it tea.

Eliza, Cole, and Bretton are all on the Wallanport team? World cup team?

<Eliza walked in. He hadn't written about her.>

She tells them about the golf tournament. Akshay asks about her last tournament. She did well.

She's sponsored by a different shop, but hates their work.

Akshay tells her about the crane. But it's one of the days that it's not there.

His shop is CRANE ARROWS.

Why didn't Judith kick her out?

---

"Did you finish those stories for Eliza Wall?" asked Judith.

"Yes, I --"

"Are they up to date on the board?"

"Since when do you care about the story board?"

Judith scowled.

"It's Friday. That consultant will be here. We're doing a retrospective."

"Ah," said Akhay. "That's too bad."

From the corner, Godwin snorted. "Piss on 'em," he said, and cackled.

Judith ignored him. "Bretton will probably be here too."

"Shit."

...on the verge of bankruptcy. He was on the fifth year of a six year, non transferrable apprenticeship.

[The shop's front door had no hinges and was designed to slide like a barn door. But there was no track to slide it in, and the shop was so crammed with archery supplies that there was no place to slide it. Instead, they propped it up outside the door.]

Wallanport was always temperate, warmed by a coastal breeze that had established a detente with the cold inland wind along the range of hills to the city's west.
