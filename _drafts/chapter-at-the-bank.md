Akshay waited in the bank's main hall, looking up into darkness. The hall was five stories high and windowless, lit exclusively by lanterns along the second story. The lanters were capped so that they only illuminated the lower two floors. Above them, the hall appeared to extend into some indefinite void.

On the floor, ten identical <marble> counters were arranged in a row that separated the publicly accessible portion of the hall from the bank tellers and the doors to the vault. Akshay leaned against one of these counters, waiting for the teller to return. He was a little surprised that the teller had even needed to go to the vault for a withdrawal of twenty marks -- that amount was usually on hand as petty cash.

After another minute of staring, Akshay thought he saw a ceiling rafter, but he blinked several times and couldn't find it again. There was a balcony on the second floor where <tourists> could admire the architecture without getting in anyone's way. Akshay gave up searching for the ceiling and watched them. They were all doing the same thing, staring up and pointing.

The bank was the tallest building in Wallanport, but not the highest. The city had two walls, an inner wall surrounding Lord Wall's manor, and an outer wall surrounding the city's merchant district. On its eastern side, the outer wall followed the edge of a low cliff, except for a small projection where a ramp had been carved into the rock. The ramp led from the eastern gates to the city's lower updistrict. This was where most of the population lived, between the cliff and the sprawling port that jutted into the Inlet Sea.

The bank was constructed against the cliff -- its vault was actually tunnelled into the rock -- and from its upper story one could see over the cliff and outer wall and into the city. Most of the buildings in the merchant district were one or two stories, and most of the buildings in the manor sprawled horizontally, but several in the manor were higher.

Because of its location outside the wall, it was popular with merchants and <nobles> from many of the holdings that bordered the Inlet Sea. Even if the city gates were closed, the bank was open. It even employed its own guards.

One of these guards accompanied the teller returning to Akshay.

"Please come with us, sir," said the teller.

"Excuse me?" asked Akshay.

...Akshay's pattern of transactions is suspicious...

5 mark, 5 mark, 15 mark, 10 mark. Always units of 5. Always deposited before dawn. And you're a permitted apprentice of an archery shop. So it's not your salary. So what is it?

"Why do you care?"

"KYC? Or do you want a business loan? Unlicensed gambling?"

"I don't need/want a loan."

"Yes, you do."

"Look, I'm going to be late for work."

...

OR Akshay gets robbed to start? And that's why he can't get in to work?
