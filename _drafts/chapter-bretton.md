Bretton Mar liked to take friends to the archery shop he owned. He was a minority owner, to be true, entitled only to a quarterly dividend. The precise value of the dividend, which he generously declined to accept, was not something he elaborated upon, and he stopped thinking about it as soon as he stopped elaborating on it.

He had invested in the shop on a whim. He was in Wallanport for the Port Crown, the city's summer archery tournament. The Wall Cup was held in the winter, and both tournaments were part of a circuit that rotated through the holdings that bordered the Inlet Sea. There was an accompanying dinner circuit which was somewhat more prestigious -- invitations could not be obtained via entry fee. At one of these dinners, the conversation at Bretton's table turned to an archery shop that was going to file for bankruptcy. If a new owner could not be found, it would be referred to the Augur's bankruptcy division, and its assets would likely be liquidated.

That would be a tragic loss, Bretton declared. Didn't they, as the next generation of Port Crown champions, owe it to themselves to make sure that their suppliers remained solvent? Someone pointed out that this particular shop didn't actually supply tournament contestants; it did contract work for the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur. But because of a dispute with Wallanport's procurement department, that contract was unlikely to be renewed. No matter, said Bretton, he would lend his capital and his expertise. Who was with him?

An ownership group quickly formed, and Bretton invested rather less of his capital and rather more of his expertise. He also loaned a collection of stuffed waterfowl, taken from his father's estate. They were hung with bowstring to the center beam that supported the shop's roof. Bretton <used them for target practice> planned to use them to test the bows and arrows that the shop's keeper was going to build from his designs.

Akshay hated the birds. He worked at the shop and three of the birds hung directly above his work bench. He had a small alcohol stove <invention> that he used for heating arrows so that he could straighten them, and he couldn't use this at his bench for fear of lighting the birds on fire.

<Bretton doesn't even live here.>

The shop's keeper never took the birds down, even when Bretton was obviously abroad. <He would visit every day for a week and then not at all for a month. When he returned, it would be with a hand drawn parchment detailing an exotic and completely unrealistic bow that he'd imagined at his last tournament. ::: this timeline is too long>

The rest of the ownership group treated the acquisition more professionally. They delegated day to day operations to a nephew of Lord Wall who worked in the procurement department. <... doesn't make sense given the contract negotiation...> He laid off Millihanna, the smith, and installed someone from supply chain management to source arrow points. He tried to renegotiate contracts with the local goose feather and wood suppliers, failed, and started importing those at a higher cost. He tried to fire Akshay too, but Akshay was on the fifth year of a six-year non-transferrable apprenticeship. The only good part about the non-transferrable piece was that Akshay couldn't be fired. After that fails, he delegates to his daughter.<???>

Then he brought in a process consultant, and at about this point, the keeper stopped showing up regularly. Akshay was left in charge. He wanted to take the birds down, but he never knew when the keeper, or Bretton would show up. It was a Friday, which meant the consultant would soon be there, which meant the keeper was there.

Bretton was an excellent marksman, he explained to his female companion, as he opened the door to the shop. But of course she knew that, as they travelled the same tournament circuit. His technical skill, however, was not the true reason to his success. Rather, it was his ability to design equipment that precisely matched his talents. After all, a tournament is never won in the shop, but it can be lost there.

"Of course I set no restrictions on these designs, do I?" he said to the shop's keeper, who rose from his stool to greet them.

"No, sir," he said, "Most generous."

Bretton took the man's hand and shook him with it.

"Anything I can think of, you can sell, I say! After all, what's good for my aim is good for my dividend."

The keeper smiled and nodded his head. There were two others in the shop, staring -- the old fletching woman with her old woman's moustache, and the apprentice, the foreign boy. Bretton waved them back to work. They waved back, obviously misinterpreting his gesture, and he ignored them.

"I forget myself," he said. "Or more accurately, I forget my esteemed companion." He half turned to the woman behind him, who was dropping her hand to her side. "Allow me to introduce a fellow professional, Lady Eliza Wall. Certain to be at the top of the <callers' lists> before the year is out."

The keeper appeared confused -- he was a reliable man, thought Bretton, but gifted with about as much understanding as a stave of wood.

"She placed in Grivougne," Bretton explained. "First in her age group, <blah>."

"Didn't she win?" <She actually won the whole thing. Bretton didn't know that. He'd DNF'ed and left early.>.

"Ah!" said Bretton, "You know her."

Eliza was attempting to suppress a smile, which Bretton found vaguely disquieting. He found humility <offputting> -- one never knows where one stands with someone who hides their accomplishments. He hadn't noticed that about her before, but she was young and pretty, and he admitted to himself that he hadn't bothered noticing anything other than that.

"Yes, actually, Ms. Wall, I have --"

Eliza interrupted, "You have one of Bretton's wonderful new designs on hand?"

The keeper looked even more confused, but said, "Yes, Akshay just finished two sheaves of those blue cedars with the tapered ends."

Bretton frowned. Akshay must be the apprentice boy. "All of my commisions are to be produced personally by you. Do I really need to remind you of that with every order?"

"No, but --"

"Akshay makes an excellent arrow," said Eliza.

"He's an amateur." said Bretton. "Probably a very competent boy, for his age. But my competition arrows aren't suited for someone else's training." He paused. "Also, how would you know?"

Eliza rolled her eyes.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship, and he was only a year or two younger than Eliza.

<...>

He demands an arrow, grabs a bow. Something is wrong | unfinished with it. He gets hurt and angry and hits the owner with a stave and Akshay shoots him in the shoulder. He gets more pissed and threatens to have Akshay killed. Eliza stabs him in the neck and that's when the agile consultant walks in.

"It's important to maintan a regular cadence for these ceremonies."

The keeper was tillering a bow, slicing off thin strips of wood from its upper limb, when Bretton opened the door.
