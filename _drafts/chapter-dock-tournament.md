title: Arrows on the Dock
permalink: /:title
---

Akshay stood on a dock in Wallanport's southern wharf. He held a bow, arrow knocked, and watched the flags on the empty ships as they snapped in the evening wind. The wind was uneven, agitated, in a hurry to chase away the day's humidity. Akshay inhaled it through his nose as he raised the bow and drew.

He took aim at the mast of the Elmer-Anne, a sharking vessel, and steadied his arm against the tension in the string. He exhaled. Released.

The arrow arced towards the ship, missed the mast, and impaled the bulwark. That would do for a second target, he thought, as he walked over to retrieve the arrow. He was testing the course that he had designed for the night's tournament. He hoped that the wind would keep up all evening; the adjustments he was making would make it too easy on a still night.

The gap between the dock and the deck of the Elmer-Anne could be crossed via two loose planks. Akshay walked across the wider one and went to work his arrow free from where it stuck in the bulwark. He had permission from the captains, Milo and Drake, to be aboard at any time, even if they and their three person crew were absent.

At the moment, they were land-side with the other sharking crews, haggling over their day's catch. The crews were in early because of the tides. Wallanport's southern and northern wharfs were seperated geographically be a narrow spit of rock that protruded for <distance> into the Inlet Sea. At low tide, the rock was just beneath the surface, and access to the southern wharf was restricted to <a smaller area>. This inconvenience meant that the southern wharf was quieter and smaller. It was popular with sharkers and foreign importers who did not want to pay the berth fees in the northern wharf.

<The northern wharf is managed by consultants from the Augur's customs division.>

Akshay owned a small boat in a berth adjacent to the Elmer-Anne. He had never sailed his ship. Before purchasing it, the harbormaster warned him that it was not seaworthy: it would stay afloat while moored to the dock, but it was likely to capsize on open water. Akshay did not mind. He lived on it, which was not uncommon in the southern wharf. He also built and sold arrows on it, which was extremely uncommon.

All of the other ships on the same dock were sharking vessels. His had been too, before its absentee owner fell four months behind on the berth fees, and the harbormaster repossessed it.

The sharkers, especially the crew of the Elmer-Anne, considered Akshay an eccentric, but a harmless one. It helped that he had a talent for mending anything with a sharp point, and that he was generous in helping the crew with their harpoons. More importantly, he knew a delicious recipe for particularly fatty cuts of fish, which < > sharks had plenty of. He had a <permanent> invitation to the Elmer-Anne to cook, eat, and gamble, and he enjoyed their gambling nearly as much as they did.

Several months before, Akshay and the crew had been on the deck of the Elmer-Anne, finishing dinner. Akshay was explaining the <archer's paradox> to Milo, who was sitting against the bulwark with his arm around Drake. Drake's eyes were closed, which meant he was bored, and Akshay was not surprised when he suddenly interrupted: "Which of us do you think would be the best shot?"

Akshay laughed and said, "Jersey, I'd wager." Jersey was the youngest and quietest of the crew.

"You'd wager," said Drake, opening his eyes and leaning forward.

Milo rolled his eyes. "That was on purpose. You said that on purpose. You could've just said, 'Jersey', or 'I don't think a single one of you could hit the side of a ship if <you were close enough to piss on it>.' But instead you had to say, 'I'd wager'."

Akshay held out his hands in mock innocence.

"How much would you wager?" asked Drake.

"Let me pick any three targets, and I'd wager half a mark that Jersey hits them before you."

Drake grinned. They all looked at Jersey. He shrugged. "I'd wager that's true."

"<Shit on all of you>" said Stace, the only woman on the crew, "Half a mark says I can hit <anything Akshay points his dick at> in fewer shots than any of you."

"<The hell you can>," said Horace. He was tall and heavy, with a deep, booming voice. "It's not a harpoon. You don't run up and stab the damn thing."

"I don't need to. Unlike you, I can actually see more than two meters in front of me --"

Actually, Horace could spot a fin in the dark at <distance>, but he tended to ignore people to whom he owed money, and his excuse of sun-blindness had earned him a repuation.

"And Jersey's too weak to even pull the string back --"

"I am not!"

"And Milo won't bet if there's a chance he'll lose. So that leaves Drake, the world's least able man, as my only competition. You can all just pay me now."

They were all grinning. Drake rubbed his hands together. "So it's like this: buy in is half a mark, second place is money back, winner gets the pot. Akshay picks three targets, fewest shots wins."

Akshay stood. "I'll go get a bow."

Milo rolled his eyes at all of them. "Of course you will."

Akshay supplied a bow and arrows. He set three practice targets at various intervals along the dock. To their surprise, Drake missed only once. His gloating would have been insufferable had his enthusiasm not been infectious. He rallied the crews of several other ships, and they began holding weekly tournaments.

The rules were codified: participants could enter with up to four arrows, at a quarter mark per arrow. Akshay would lay out the course, and participants had to hit each target in order. They could reuse an arrow after a hit, but a miss resulted in loss of the arrow. Often this was because the arrow was irretrievable, lost to the Inlet Sea. Since Akshay supplied all the arrows, they started paying him back out of the pot before paying out the winner.

This week, Akshay was going to have them hit <...>, the side of the Elmer-Anne, an empty salt barrel supplied by the crew of the Merry Belle, and <...>.

After reclaiming his arrow from the side of the Elmer-Anne, Akshay raised his bow and sighted at the salt barrel. He matched his breath to the gentle rocking of the ship as he watched a patch of white caps beating towards shore. On his next inhale he drew, and he heard a man say, "Five marks he goes wide left."

A familiar woman's voice replied, "<My God>, you're rude. I told you to watch."

Akshay caught his breath, then forced himself to exhale and release. The arrow hit the right side of the barrel and glanced off it, into the water. He frowned, just as the rough patch of waves passed under the ship and a gust of wind hit him.

"Lucky gust," said the man.

Akshay turned to look at him and said, "Five marks, then?"

The man laughed, and Akshay crossed the deck and the planks to the dock. "Eliza," he said, nodding at the woman.

"Akshay," she replied. "This is Cole. Apparently I've been talking about you too much, and he insisted on meeting you."

"Well," said Akshay, "It's five marks for the pleasure."

"Come on," said Cole. "I was joking."

Akshay raised his eyebrows. It was very bad form to interrupt someone mid-draw. Even the sharkers knew that.

The two men stared at each other.

"Oh, let it go," said Eliza.

"Would've been wide left, anyway, if the wind hadn't saved it," said Cole.

Akshay looked at Eliza and knew that she didn't need him to say, "That's not letting it go." He said it anyway.

"Look," she said. "I heard you've been running some kind of tournament out here. Something fun. I've been meaning to come down and see. And Cole's interested in some business out here, so I thought, why not tonight? But I see you're the only one here, so I must've heard wrong. We'll see you around."

"Fine," said Akshay.

Cole smiled with his mouth and not his eyes, and Akshay wished he had an arrow to aim at the man's face.

Akshay watched them walk back <down the dock> to shore. They passed Drake, who was on his way back to the Elmer-Anne.

"Who's that?" asked Drake, when he reached the ship. "Looked like <one hell of > a lamb-eating land-sider ."

"Doesn't matter. Where's Milo?"

"<something about repairs for tomorrow>. That woman's been out here now and again, hasn't she?"

"Yes. I have to get another arrow. Damn gust."

Akshay didn't bother practicing the rest of the course.

The wind calmed, and Jersey won the tournament. It was his first win, and he needed only ne arrow. The celebration culminated in the young man getting dumped overboard, but Akshay had already gone back to his boat.
