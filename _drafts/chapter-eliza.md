The water was boiling, so Eliza set her bow on the table and went to retrieve the kettle from the fire. She set the kettle on a <towel> on the table, next to the bow. The two porcelain tea cups were still in the wash basin, one chipped above its handle, the other with a harline crack running straight through the willow tree that decorated its side. She didn't trust the keyogi with either of these, especially on the roof, so she left them in the basin and got two wooden cups from the cupboard.

She <shook some loose leaf tea> into each cup and poured the steaming water in. While the water cooled, she went to wriggle an arrow free from the painting she had been shooting at. Its canvas was riddled with holes -- what hadn't been shot out was mostly orange. Eliza couldn't remember what the painting had been of, but she liked it more this way. It was from her childhood bedroom. She still remembered the feeling of anger at being confined there, though she couldn't remember what she had done to earn the confinement.

The painting was the first thing she had unpacked after moving into her new house, a month before. The house was small: drawing room, kitchen, and bedroom. It had been built as a carriage house on one of the older properties in old Wallanport, right up against the edge of the city's namesake wall. The property was in disrepair -- the owner, a friend of an older cousin of Lord Wall, had died abroad without telling anyone.

A clerk from the Augur's tax and revenue divison was the first to notice. The tax and revenue division was looking to expand from its office in the manor, and the clerk was scanning city records to look for unpaid property taxes. The main house was promptly condemned. After demolition, the <lucky|diligent|prodigous> clerk was going to be promoted to management of a new office to be built in its place.

Meanwhile, the carriage house, structurally sound but too small for the department's staff, went up for auction. The auction coincided with the advance from Eliza's first sponsorship. She had just won two consecutive field archery tournaments and was now sponsored by <a shipping company?>. <Her agent buys it for her. She moved in.>

Her possessions were stacked in crates in the drawing room. She opened a crate at random, and the hole-ridden painting greeted her. She lifted it out. The rest of the crate was stuffed with rarely worn formal dresses. An odd pairing, she thought, holding the canvas out in front of her.

Eliza placed the painting upright against the wall, balanced on a crate, a bit above eye level. Her bows, except for her favorite, were all crated. Her favorite, a <cedar longbow>, stood next to the door, and she left the painting and picked up the bow and strung it. It was easy to find two arrows -- most of the crates had arrows in them. Loose arrows, sheaves of arrows. Broken arrows, tournament winning arrows. Arrows, more arrows.

She took bow and arrows to the adjacent room, the kitchen, where she had a clean line of sight back to the painting. In quick succession, she knocked each arrow, aimed, smiled, and pinned the painting to the wall.

There was a couch under the painting now, and she knelt on this as she pulled the arrow out of the center of the painting -- the two that she had used to hang it were still in place.

There was a keyogi living on the roof. Small, fat bear shaped animal that walks on all four and likes tea.

I had thought that her thing was going to be that she was interested in the narratives people tell themselves.

But maybe she's just an obsessive.

So how does she end up running the rangers?

And how does this lead to her killing bretton?
