Leonard Garrett was nearly the defending champion of the ten-mark league. Drafting Eliza Wall for a quarter-mark had been a brilliant pick. He had seen her last year in the qualification rounds for the Port Crown. She was shooting beautifully when an arrow shaft shattered on release and impaled her draw hand. She had to withdraw from the tournament, and even though she missed the rest of the season, Leonard kept her in mind. When he saw her name on the entrants list for Ternfelden B, last month's tournament, he knew he had his <dark horse>.

Then there was his trade for Stephen Chelde, which would have won him the league, if Chelde hadn't <choked> in the semi-finals and missed his first four targets, and the thing about <fantasy> archery, thought Akshay, as he ignored Leonard, is that noone cares about your team except for you. Especially not the league organizer as he scrambles to finish all of the draft sheets just fiften minutes before the auction is supposed to begin. Akshay shook the sheet that he had just finished, attempting to hurry the drying ink.

Leonard and Akshay sat at a table in the usual port-side tavern. There weren't enough tables for everyone else, and the tavern master was already mad at them. They hadn't predicted this turn-out, and the tavern master hadn't gotten enough pork rinds -- his signature dish -- at the afternoon market. He would probably run out of them by the end of the night, and this left him seething and short on sympathy.

Originally a tavern joke taken too seriously, Akshay's <fantasy> archery leagues had <multiplied> in popularity. They had started six months before, on the eve of the Wall Cup, Wallanport's summer <field|sprint> archery tournament. Akshay had brought a copy of the entry list to banter over with a small group of friends. Someone, probably Leonard, suggested that they organize their hypothetical bets, and suddenly Akshay was playing auctioneer, reading names from the entry list for the group to bid on. The highest bidder would draft that archer and score the points that he or she earned in the tournament. They set a limit of four archers each and a maximum total bid of ten marks. Akshay collected the money from each bid to distribute to whoever finished the tournament with the highest scoring team.

The next month, for the tournament in Grivougne, they were joined by some friends of friends. Akshay ran auction drafts for two leagues, each with a ten mark cap. After that, for Ternfelden A, they added a league with a twenty mark cap. Then three more months and three more tournaments as the tournament circuit continued on, rotating through the holdings that bordered the Inlet Sea, oblivous to the wagering in a port-side tavern in Wallanport.

<Transition sentence.> Participants started coming to the archery shop where Akshay was apprenticed, to tell him that they had just traded so-and-so and could he update their teams. And he had to be at the docks as soon as the news boats moored, ready to copy down the tournament results as soon as they were cried.

It was all a great deal of fun until the day before the Port Crown. Leonard was the first to warn him: "From the manor, Akshay! There are people from the manor who want to buy in."

The manor was really an entire city district. The city of Wallanport had two walls, and the inner-most wall surrounded the manor. This was where Lord Wall's extended family lived, along with anyone wealthy enough to afford a friendship with the branch of the family that managed the manor's real estate.

Leonard's warning appeared to be true. The usual collection of devotees was gathering at the tavern for the monthly draft, but strangers kept joining them, nodding at Akshay's table as if they were expected. Four men arrived in clean, pressed tunics. They wore the loose, thin pants common on the manor: comfortable in Wallanport's coastal humidity and useless for manual labor. The men surveyed the room and discussed something. One of them detached himself and found the tavern master. A group of early arrivals were evicted from their table, and the four men seated themselves in their place. A large bowl of rinds was promptly provided.

Meanwhile, Akshay finished another draft sheet and shook it dry. He didn't have any more paper left in his satchel, so they would have to stop at eight leagues.

"You have all the names up on the board?" he asked.

"Yes, yes," said Leonard. "We carted it down from the university this morning. Bright idea that was. It's over by the bar under that blanket so that the chalk doesn't get mussed."

"Good."

"Oh, the mule cart rental was two marks. Can you get that back to me tonight?"

"I thought the point of you having a friend at the university was so we could get the board for free."

Leonard shrugged. "We did. I didn't pay him a thing. But a slate board has some heft. We weren't going to carry that all the way here by ourselves."

"This whole thing is going to end up costing us money."

"Only if you're an idiot. How much are you raking per league?"

"The usual. Four marks."

"You're an idiot. Even for the uncapped league?"

"I hadn't thought about it yet. Honestly, that table from the manor has me worried. How did they hear about this?"

"Don't worry about them. Just take two percent from each league. That'll be cheaper for the capped leagues, and we'll make up the difference on the uncapped one."

"Fine. I can't think about it. I don't know how I'm going to run eight leagues. I have an actual job."

"Akshay, friend, <comrade>, relax. Look at me. I'm just here to see how many leagues I can draft Eliza in."

Akshay rolled his eyes and picked up his draft sheets. There was no room to push his chair back because an argument at the table behind him had been surrounded by two rows of <standees>. They debated whether or not Chelde's <performance was due to doping, cheating, or something>. Akshay squeezed out of his chair and made his way to the the draft board. He pulled off the blanket and quickly compared the names on it to the reference sheet he had inked in the morning.

There were thirty two names on the board, comprising the entire entry list to this month's <field|sprint> archery tournament. <...>

Akshay banged on the bar, and the room quieted.

"Glad you're all here," he said. "If you are, I assume you know the rules. You buy into a league, you pay me at the end of that league's draft. We're starting with a ten-mark league, four archers per team --"

"Ten marks?" said someone. "Let's not waste time here."

Akshay found the speaker, one of the men from the manor.

"Fine," Akshay said. "We'll do uncapped first. House takes two percent."

"I'll take Metcalf for fifteen marks," said the same man.

"I see we aren't clear on the rules. I read, and you --"

"Twenty," said one of the other men at the table.

"Twenty-five."

"Twenty-six."

"Don't be a donkey's ass and bid me up by one."

"Fine, thirty."

"Thirty-five."

Silence.

"Well, are you going to write that down? Metcalf for thirty-five. Honestly, we could've just done this ourselves and saved the trip port-side."

"Forty," said Leonard.

"Leonard, what --"

"Who's this, Martin? Some actual competition here?"

"Leave him, Metcalf's a <clown>."

"Leonard --" Akshay attempted again.

"Write it down," Leonard interrupted. "Forty marks on Florence Metcalf."

The two other manor-men laughed and clapped. "Forty on Chelde," said one of them.

Akshay took a deep breath. He was book keeper now, not auctioneer, and Chelde was going for seventy-five marks, which turned out to be a discount, given how the manor-men kept bidding each other up.

They filled their four person teams without further competition from Leonard or anyone else, and demanded their totals from Akshay: 340, 475, 490, and 600 marks, respectively. After a quick conference, one of them pulled out a thin paper, wrote on it, and passed it to the next table, gesturing in Akshay's direction. The paper was handed to Akshay as the men left the tavern.

"<1000 total> marks on credit at the Bank Staverton," Akshay read aloud.

There was silence in the room, until Leonard shouted, "Well? Who wants a lottery ticket?"

"Half a mark on Frideswide," someone called, to general laughter.

"Shut it, Colmer, unless you're from the manor and forgot to tell us," said Leonard, "And let Akshay run it like we always do."

"Great. Thanks. That's a half mark on Frideswide. Any takers?"

It took longer than usual to get through the rest of the thirty two names. Bidding was aggressive, and Akshay started to worry if the bidders even had the money to back up their calls, but they all dutifully paid up.

Three hours later, they finished the eighth and final draft. Many of the participants in the earlier drafts had already left. Akshay and Leonard tallied the money at the table. There was 160 _ 4 + 320 _ 3 + 160 + a bank note for <1000>.

"I don't really want to be carrying this around," said Akshay.

"Staverton's open all night, isn't it?"

"I don't know. I don't usually do my banking after midnight."

"I'm sure it is. Let's go."

Akshay <left> an extra ten marks for the tavern master, in apology, and they left the tavern.
