It was early in Wallanport, and the coastal air was thick and humid and still. Cold, too, since the morning chill had not yet retreated back to the hills. Akshay waited outside the archery shop where he worked, alternately squatting and standing, breathing on his hands to keep them warm.

He watched the silhouette of a stone crane land on a roof across the street. The bird would perch there, statuesque, until the cool, evening wind rolled down from the western hills and blew it and the humidity out to sea.

Other stone cranes circled the city in languid, solitary loops. Akshay heard them calling, though he was never sure who they were calling to -- there were such long silences between their cries.

Inside the shop, he heard Godwin, the old fletcher, stacking wood by the stove. The man was imperturbable. Akshay was in the fifth year of a six-year, non transferrable apprenticeship. Every morning for the first two months of his apprenticeship, he had banged on the shop's back door, imploring Godwin to let him in. It never happened.

<Godwin needs to be more absurd. Shoots arrows out the door.>

So he learned to content himself with waiting for Judith, the shop's owner. While he waited, he played games to keep warm: hopping on one leg up and down the crates that led to the front door, running little sprints back and forth between the archery shop and the adjacent <paper> shop. And he acquainted himself with the crane that perched on the opposite roof. It resolutely ignored him, but Akshay believed that it did so amiably. Being in one another's presence was not a hardship, though they could do nothing for one another.

Unlike Godwin, who could have just opened the back door.

---

"Don't get here so early," said Judith, as she unlocked the chain that held the shop's front door in place.

"Gate traffic," said Akshay.

"And wear a coat."

"I won't want it when I'm walking home."

This was their morning routine. It was more greeting than Akshay ever received from Godwin.

After Judith <coiled up the chain>, Akshay picked up the door. The shop's front entrance had no hinges. It was designed for a sliding door, like a barn's, but there was no track for a door to slide along. It was also elevated above the street, but no porch, landing, or stairs had ever been built. Instead, two crates were weighted with scrap wood, turned upside down, and used as steps. Every morning after Judith unlocked the door, Akshay had to carry it down the false steps and prop it up against the wall.

As for the gate traffic: Wallanport had two walls, an inner wall that surrounded Lord Wall's manor and an outer wall that surrounded most of the city's <commercial> district. The archery shop was in the latter district, between the two walls, or colloquially: "through the gate". There were twelve gates in the outer wall, laid out like a clock. Work permits were required to pass through any of them. Ever since gate security had been out-sourced to the Augur, the permits where thoroughly vetted, and traffic started to back up even before dawn. It could take an hour to get through on a busy day. Rumor held that the Augur was creating the slowdowns intentionally in order to justify bringing on more staff, but the only new staff that ever came on seemed to be for "line security" to prevent fights from breaking out among impatient workers. Akshay made sure to get to the quarter-gate well before dawn, before the officious morning security shift had come to post, and before the stone cranes had settled to the roofs.

Like most of Wallanport's working population, Akshay lived outside the gates, between the outer wall and the sprawling port that connected the city to the Inlet Sea. Godwin should have lived there too, but Judith let him sleep in the shop, curled up in the back corner with the sacks of goose fletchings. It was not clear why she let him stay there, other than maybe as an excuse to not pay him.

Judith lived in the manor, which was unusual since she did not have any obvious friends among the many relatives of Lord Wall. "In the manor" was another colloquialism. There was an entire city district within the inner walls, home mostly to Lord Wall's many relatives and hangers on. Judith never talked about the manor or the specifics of where she lived. But then, she talked only slightly more than Godwin (who spoke only to announce that he was hungry and wanted to eat), and she never volunteered unnecessary specifics. Akshay often wondered if his own conversation ability was deteriorating in their company. At least sometimes there were customers.

The shop had a wood stove in the center, which they used to heat and bend bow staves and arrow shafts. Judith and Akshay worked on opposite sides, Judith with her back to the entrance. Godwin did his fletching work in the back corner. He muttered if anyone got to close, but it came out like a growl and most customers found it disturbing. Akshay did too.

In the winter, the cold wind from the western hills sometimes lingered through the day, but even then the situation with the door was not much of a problem. Akshay dragged his work bench closer to the stove. Godwin insulated himself with goose quills -- Akshay had actually seen him stuffing them down his shirt -- and then spent the next few hours removing them in sets of threes to use as arrow fletchings.

Judith never seemed to notice the cold. She also did not take notice of the stone crane that perched across the street, no matter how many mornings Akshay pointed it out. This annoyed him, and it annoyed him that he was annoyed by it. Sometimes, with no conversation to interrupt his thoughts, he stewed on this for entire days. The crane ought to be their patron, he thought. But he thought that he did not seriously think that, so why did it matter?

Judith took a further lack of notice of the occasional customer that entered the shop, and it was Akshay's job to nod to her if the customer was worth her attention. She had taken Akshay on as an apprentice because he could read and write, and he took all the orders that did not absolutely require her. There were not many of these. Mostly they did contract work for the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been outsourced to the Augur.

<Something about the tournament circuit? Archery in Wallanport?>

---

It was stable work, thought Akshay, as he worked at his bench, planing square dowels of cedar into cylindrical arrow shafts. He was composing a letter to his mother in his head. She lived in Grivougne, a holding across the Inlet Sea. His uncle had secured this apprenticeship for Akshay's fourteenth birthday, and Akshay had not seen either of them since emigrating. But he still wrote.

Stable, satisfying work. He spent the first weeks of his apprenticeship shadowing Godwin, dreading both the man and the monotony of what awaited him. Now, five years later, it was easier to imagine five years turning into fifteen or twenty years. He enjoying planing shafts and tillering bows and he had the time to do it well. Judith was not warm, and Godwin was barely civil, but they nodded their approval when they liked his work. Five years in, that nod was no longer such a rarity.

Akshay would earn his professional certification in another year and then he was free to do whatever he liked. As long as it had something to do with archery. So he would probably stay here, since he did not have the money to start his own shop, and anyway, how many archery shops could one city support?

Probably quite a few, actually, but he had already written a letter about that. There had not been a border war in eight years, and the archery tournament circuit that rotated through the holdings of the Inlet Sea was <extremely popular>. The craftsmanship required for a tournament contestant was significantly higher than what was required for an army, and the <field> was only beginning to grasp the scope of innovation that awaited it.

Akshay had a few ideas of his own -- but he had written a letter about that too. He wondered if his mother cared about the ideas, or if she was just happy that he wrote, or if she even cared that he did.

---

"Judith. You're here."

Akshay cocked his head. He didn't know this person. Judith was cringing. She did.

---

"I'm not explaining myself well. Let me play that back. You're not understanding me."

The contract is now contingent on an agile consultant?

---

A woman entered into the shop, and a man followed, and they were apparently mid-argument. It was very sudden. There was no door to open. The woman was holding a keyogi in her arms -- a small, bear shaped animal that walked on all fours. Akshay did not trust the things. They lived on roofs, and he had heard that they ate stone crane eggs.

"Honestly, Eliza," the man said. "You're overreacting."

Judith raised her eyebrows at Akshay without lifting her gaze from the sinew that she was attaching to a bow for backing. He shrugged. She reluctantly turned around.

"Honestly, Bretton," said Eliza, "That was the most predictable thing you could've said." To the room, she said, as if in accusation: "This is the last independent shop in Wallanport, isn't it?"

"The last independent what?" asked Judith, with a feigned politeness that made Akshay nervous. There was sudden noise and conflict and a furry animal, and these things would make her tense. Judith could be very threatening when tense, and she had immediate access to weaponry.

"Bretton has just sold his share in Rampart Bows to the Augur's <> division. They produce all of their arrows in Ternfelden and have them shipped and they're shit and there's no way to get custom work done. And now they own every damn shop in Wallanport except this one, which I'd never have heard about except that my uncle works in procurement so I know you can at least make military shit. Shit! What a shit. Do you do custom work, or just the standard fire ten arrows hope one sticks military shit?"

Without waiting for an answer, she turned on Bretton, the keyogi outstretched in front of her. It was chattering, making a fast paced clicking sound.

"What the hell did you think I was going to think? This is wonderful, Bretton, just wonderful. You're wonderful. I'm so impressed. Your financial acumen is unparalleled. You're a fucking idiot. This is why you don't win a fucking thing because all the equipment you ever use is shit. I'm declining my sponsorship. Tell Rampart to fuck himself. Better yet, fuck him yourself."

---

Something else. Procurement has hired an agile team?

---

Eliza visits again.

---

How do I get from there to killing Bretton? Or to the consultants?

---

Eliza walks in, holding a keyogi. I was giving it tea.

Eliza, Cole, and Bretton are all on the Wallanport team? World cup team?

<Eliza walked in. He hadn't written about her.>

She tells them about the golf tournament. Akshay asks about her last tournament. She did well.

She's sponsored by a different shop, but hates their work.

Akshay tells her about the crane. But it's one of the days that it's not there.

His shop is CRANE ARROWS.

Why didn't Judith kick her out?

---

"Did you finish those stories for Eliza Wall?" asked Judith.

"Yes, I --"

"Are they up to date on the board?"

"Since when do you care about the story board?"

Judith scowled.

"It's Friday. That consultant will be here. We're doing a retrospective."

"Ah," said Akhay. "That's too bad."

From the corner, Godwin snorted. "Piss on 'em," he said, and cackled.

Judith ignored him. "Bretton will probably be here too."

"Shit."

...on the verge of bankruptcy. He was on the fifth year of a six year, non transferrable apprenticeship.

[The shop's front door had no hinges and was designed to slide like a barn door. But there was no track to slide it in, and the shop was so crammed with archery supplies that there was no place to slide it. Instead, they propped it up outside the door.]

Wallanport was always temperate, warmed by a coastal breeze that had established a detente with the cold inland wind along the range of hills to the city's west.

---

Bretton Mar liked to take friends to the archery shop he owned. He was a minority owner, to be true, entitled only to a quarterly dividend. The precise value of the dividend, which he generously declined to accept, was not something he elaborated upon, and he stopped thinking about it as soon as he stopped elaborating on it.

He had invested in the shop on a whim. He was in Wallanport for the Port Crown, the city's summer archery tournament. The Wall Cup was held in the winter, and both tournaments were part of a circuit that rotated through the holdings that bordered the Inlet Sea. There was an accompanying dinner circuit which was somewhat more prestigious -- invitations could not be obtained via entry fee. At one of these dinners, the conversation at Bretton's table turned to an archery shop that was going to file for bankruptcy. If a new owner could not be found, it would be referred to the Augur's bankruptcy division, and its assets would likely be liquidated.

That would be a tragic loss, Bretton declared. Didn't they, as the next generation of Port Crown champions, owe it to themselves to make sure that their suppliers remained solvent? Someone pointed out that this particular shop didn't actually supply tournament contestants; it did contract work for the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur. But because of a dispute with Wallanport's procurement department, that contract was unlikely to be renewed. No matter, said Bretton, he would lend his capital and his expertise. Who was with him?

An ownership group quickly formed, and Bretton invested rather less of his capital and rather more of his expertise. He also loaned a collection of stuffed waterfowl, taken from his father's estate. They were hung with bowstring to the center beam that supported the shop's roof. Bretton <used them for target practice> planned to use them to test the bows and arrows that the shop's keeper was going to build from his designs.

Akshay hated the birds. He worked at the shop and three of the birds hung directly above his work bench. He had a small alcohol stove <invention> that he used for heating arrows so that he could straighten them, and he couldn't use this at his bench for fear of lighting the birds on fire.

<Bretton doesn't even live here.>

The shop's keeper never took the birds down, even when Bretton was obviously abroad. <He would visit every day for a week and then not at all for a month. When he returned, it would be with a hand drawn parchment detailing an exotic and completely unrealistic bow that he'd imagined at his last tournament. ::: this timeline is too long>

The rest of the ownership group treated the acquisition more professionally. They delegated day to day operations to a nephew of Lord Wall who worked in the procurement department. <... doesn't make sense given the contract negotiation...> He laid off Millihanna, the smith, and installed someone from supply chain management to source arrow points. He tried to renegotiate contracts with the local goose feather and wood suppliers, failed, and started importing those at a higher cost. He tried to fire Akshay too, but Akshay was on the fifth year of a six-year non-transferrable apprenticeship. The only good part about the non-transferrable piece was that Akshay couldn't be fired. After that fails, he delegates to his daughter.<???>

Then he brought in a process consultant, and at about this point, the keeper stopped showing up regularly. Akshay was left in charge. He wanted to take the birds down, but he never knew when the keeper, or Bretton would show up. It was a Friday, which meant the consultant would soon be there, which meant the keeper was there.

---

Bretton was an excellent marksman, he explained to his female companion, as he opened the door to the shop. But of course she knew that, as they travelled the same tournament circuit. His technical skill, however, was not the true reason to his success. Rather, it was his ability to design equipment that precisely matched his talents. After all, a tournament is never won in the shop, but it can be lost there.

"Of course I set no restrictions on these designs, do I?" he said to the shop's keeper, who rose from his stool to greet them.

"No, sir," he said, "Most generous."

Bretton took the man's hand and shook him with it.

"Anything I can think of, you can sell, I say! After all, what's good for my aim is good for my dividend."

The keeper smiled and nodded his head. There were two others in the shop, staring -- the old fletching woman with her old woman's moustache, and the apprentice, the foreign boy. Bretton waved them back to work. They waved back, obviously misinterpreting his gesture, and he ignored them.

"I forget myself," he said. "Or more accurately, I forget my esteemed companion." He half turned to the woman behind him, who was dropping her hand to her side. "Allow me to introduce a fellow professional, Lady Eliza Wall. Certain to be at the top of the <callers' lists> before the year is out."

The keeper appeared confused -- he was a reliable man, thought Bretton, but gifted with about as much understanding as a stave of wood.

"She placed in Grivougne," Bretton explained. "First in her age group, <blah>."

"Didn't she win?" <She actually won the whole thing. Bretton didn't know that. He'd DNF'ed and left early.>.

"Ah!" said Bretton, "You know her."

Eliza was attempting to suppress a smile, which Bretton found vaguely disquieting. He found humility <offputting> -- one never knows where one stands with someone who hides their accomplishments. He hadn't noticed that about her before, but she was young and pretty, and he admitted to himself that he hadn't bothered noticing anything other than that.

"Yes, actually, Ms. Wall, I have --"

Eliza interrupted, "You have one of Bretton's wonderful new designs on hand?"

The keeper looked even more confused, but said, "Yes, Akshay just finished two sheaves of those blue cedars with the tapered ends."

Bretton frowned. Akshay must be the apprentice boy. "All of my commisions are to be produced personally by you. Do I really need to remind you of that with every order?"

"No, but --"

"Akshay makes an excellent arrow," said Eliza.

"He's an amateur." said Bretton. "Probably a very competent boy, for his age. But my competition arrows aren't suited for someone else's training." He paused. "Also, how would you know?"

Eliza rolled her eyes.

---

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship, and he was only a year or two younger than Eliza.

<...>

He demands an arrow, grabs a bow. Something is wrong | unfinished with it. He gets hurt and angry and hits the owner with a stave and Akshay shoots him in the shoulder. He gets more pissed and threatens to have Akshay killed. Eliza stabs him in the neck and that's when the agile consultant walks in.

"It's important to maintan a regular cadence for these ceremonies."

---

The keeper was tillering a bow, slicing off thin strips of wood from its upper limb, when Bretton opened the door.

---

Everyone in the shop

Akshay tapped the unfletched shaft of an arrow against his knee.

Akshay rubbed the stubble of beard growing on his chin.

Akshay watched the woman rearranging, and didn't offer to help.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship.

Sheaves of arrows lined the shop, which the woman was trying to rearrange.

When he was younger, he had apprenticed in an all-inclusive archery store. The store was on the verge of bankruptcy because the owner had disavowed the commonly held belief that free life time maintenance should be included with the purchase of any bow. Lacking substantial competitive, hobbyist, or mercenary clientele, it owed its solvency to an annual contract with the Wallanport rangers, one of the few military units that had not been out-sourced to the Augur.

"Didn't Godwin finish this story?"

"I don't know," said Akshay. "Why don't you ask him?"

"It's been in progress since last week, and it's only a three. Is that right, for ten sheaves of arrows?"

"Was that just for the fletching?"

"Yes, you had the stories for the shafts and the points. And those are over here in Done."

"Oh, those arrows are all done. I took them up to the manor yesterday."

"Then why is Godwin's story still in progress? What's he doing now?"

"I don't know. Maybe ask him?"

"What did he say at standup yesterday?"

"He hasn't come to standup since we started doing it by the story wall."

"But that was two weeks ago!"

"Yes."

"We'll need to discuss this at the retrospective."

"OK."

Ineffective v effective behaviors
Conduct a survey

### Fletching background

By law the populous had to save the quills from the Geese they ate, which would be periodically collected and deposited at the nearest fletcher.

Smiths would be hired to produce bodkins by the thousand (A piece of an iron rod that's been snipped into 5 - 7cm pieces, beaten at one end to a point, and flat, and rolled into a socket at the other end, at a rate of 500 a day, per smith).

Every village and land owner had coppiced woods to provide both firewood and the arrow shafts, when requested.

The fletchers then simply orderd several barrels of bodkins, the requisite number of shafts, a few barrels of pine sap, some miles of linen thread, and gets the family, and apprentices sticking.

Arrow boys were young men, often teenagers considered too weakly/unskilled to fight, sent into battlefields to retrieve fired arrows for their side.

If you are hunting or target shooting, then you need an arrow that is carefully made to fly very straight and true. If you are shooting a barrage of arrows with a lot of other archers to create a storm of arrows striking the enemy force at one time, the need for super quality is much less.

The arrows themselves are difficult. They are made of multiple pieces which each have their own supply train and manufacturing difficulty. For long range arrows the arrow head is made of iron, but two compounds, a hard edge and a softer core to absorb shock on impact, a 30 inch shaft constructed of lighter wood which has to be basically perfectly straight or it's useless. The fletchings are made of goose feathers, and this requires the plucking of a lot of geese. Shorter range arrows are a little shorter, heavier, made of a thicker piece of hard wood like ash and have a head called a bodkin which is very narrow for penetrating armor at close range.

A typical day in the life of a medieval bowyer, also commonly known as a fletcher, would have involved a lot of tedious but important work. The making of bows required a certain level of skill and training and their products were often in high demand, especially in England which made great use of its archers in battle.

A bowyer typically lived in a town. Like other craftsmen, he probably lived in a simple house with his family located above his workshop and storefront. There were usually other workshops of the same kind on the same street. The bowyer may even have kept some small livestock in the home/workshop such as a few chickens.

On a typical day, a bowyer would awake early, around first light and eat a simple breakfast of hardtack, salted meat or fish, and fresh fruit or vegetables if they were available. He would then head downstairs for work. It was typical for craftsmen to have an apprentice or two. These boys would help the bowyer with the daily tasks in exchange for on the job training. Think of it like an internship. They might even live with the bowyer during their several years of training.

Throughout the day, the bowyer and his apprentices would work to construct bows and perhaps arrows also. They would use tools for cutting and shaping wood for their purposes. A bowyer might spend part of his day finding and purchasing materials at a toolmaker's workshop elsewhere in town or buying raw materials, such as ash, yew, or hickory wood at the town market.

Likely, one of the first jobs of the day for the bowyer (but more likely one of his apprentices) would be to build a fire and set a large cauldron of water to boil over it. Once it was creating a good amount of steam, the bowyer would set an unfinished bow over it to make it playable. It would then be set on a rack to shape it into its final form.

The bowyer might also spend some part of his day taking in work orders from customers. Usually, products were built on demand. He might work on a single high-quality bow for a particular customer, or take in a large order on behalf of a company of archers.

Usually, a bowyer would work throughout the day as long as there was light to see by. He would occasionally have evening meetings with his guild to clear up any issues among the bowyer community or to set standards. A guild was an organization of craftsmen in a certain line of work who would meet to set fair prices, ensure quality control, and provide collective job security.

At the end of the workday, the fires would be extinguished, the apprentices sent on their way, and the workshop closed down until the following morning.
