Akshay tapped the unfletched shaft of an arrow against his knee.

Akshay rubbed the stubble of beard growing on his chin.

Akshay watched the woman rearranging, and didn't offer to help.

Akshay was on the fifth year of a six year, non-transferrable apprenticeship.

"Oh, those arrows are all done. I took them up to the manor yesterday."

"Then why is Godwin's story still in progress? What's he doing now?"

"I don't know. Maybe ask him?"

"What did he say at standup yesterday?"

"He hasn't come to standup since we started doing it by the story wall."

"But that was two weeks ago!"

"Yes."

"We'll need to discuss this at the retrospective."

"OK."
