## Winter solstice scheduling

We celebrate the future of the year that was on the first Monday after the winter solstice. Budgets are allocated on Wednesday. In between, on Tuesday, is New Project Day. 

The schedule of those events is supposed to symbolize the cycle of time. Our motto is "live the future" -- the idea is to always strive to create the future we want from the past we share. Working tirelessly towards this goal will earn us untold glory and profit which we are permitted to celebrate for three hours after work on a hideously cold, dark Monday night.

I think the real reason for the compressed schedule is because the Chief leaves for the southern office on the first Thursday after the solstice. The harbor usually will not freeze for another five weeks, and it is usually only impassable for two or three weeks after that. But twenty years ago, it was frozen from solstice Friday straight through for three months. Since it happened once, it can happen again, so the Chief always sails on Thursday and stays for three months and two days. (Any meeting scheduled for the first week of his return is liable to be rescheduled due to bad winds.) 

## Presentation preparation

Every team dreads New Project Day, or rather, every team dreads the two weeks leading up to it. Formal presentations are mandatory, but since the design team always has two or three of their own proposals, they refuse to work on any of the other teams' slides. That leaves everyone else scrambling to contract their own letterers, numberers, and muralists.

Everyone attends New Project Day (to prepare to live the future), and the only space that will fit us all is the assembly hall. The slides have to be enormous so that everyone can see them, and they require slide-holders to move them safely. People grumble that the slide-holder agencies always overstate their invoices, but when you consider that the slide-holders have to be re-trained multiple times, it makes sense. 

Each presentation has to go through two dry runs with the relevant department director's chief of staff. The first set of changes is inevitably capricious. The second set reverts those changes such that the final product is basically the original content in a different order. This seems inefficient, but it serves an important purpose: the chiefs of staff can boast to their directors about the wisdom and insight of their feedback.

## The office lighting budget

I work in facilities. We do not ever propose new projects, but drown me if I do not dread New Project Day as much as anyone. For us, the trouble always begins on Budget Day of the previous year. Given how much finance loves us, I would not expect our budget to be a problem, but it is. I should clarify: finance does not love us, finance loves line items. We have a lot of line items. Endless, detailed, tangible line items. Here is a sample from the section on lighting: 

- New wall lantern sconces for small conference room modernization; replacement rate of 5%
- Repair for hanging lantern sconces in large conference rooms and assembly hall; assumed failure rate of 3.5%
- New portable office lanterns; assumed damage or loss rate of 8%
- Tallow candles for associates; 160 per associate

The problem we have, in addition to how long it takes for us to compile the budget (we have to base failure rates on three year rolling averages), is that these line items are not fungible. Finance will not let us move a surplus from one area over to another; they just wait until next Budget Day and roll the surplus forward. This means that by New Project Day we have run out of supplies in all sorts of areas that finance will not approve expenses for.

Lantern oil has been the biggest issue this year. It is by far our biggest lighting expense. Four years ago, we managed to stockpile several unused barrels of oil. Since then, we have started to run out weeks before the solstice. This year is going to be the worst yet, and we do not have anything left from that four year vintage. 

Other departmental budgets account for projected hiring, but finance does not let us factor that in to our budgets. They reason that the size of the office is not growing, so we have to keep using the historical rolling averages. But as more employees are hired, the conference rooms see increased use, and lanterns must be lit more frequently. This depletes our oil supply faster than the budget accounts for, and the inevitability of shortages are obvious within three months of Budget Day.

The market rate for oil has also been a problem. Eleum oil is the best: it burns cleanly and has no odor. Ideally, we would have enough to light the executive suites year round, but the oil is made from eleum flowers, which are biennial. We held off on purchasing imported eleum for four months, hoping the price would drop, but we had to give in after multiple directors complained to my boss.

Olive oil also works well, but it too has been expensive. Even fish oil spiked briefly, but it was quickly over-supplied. We could probably purchase enough of that to last for another two years, but the problem is: it is fish oil. It stinks. Imagine lighting the entire assembly hall with fish oil. The perfume wafting from the lanterns would mix with the stench of our rank employees and end New Project Day hours early.

## The optimal presentation time slot

In advance of next week's New Project Day, we started rationing the candles we allocate to associates. Since they share desks, they are already expected to share one candle per two associates. We told all of them, except for the ones in finance and HR (never start a brawl you cannot win), that their allotment was decreasing by twenty five percent each. They seem to be getting by.

Thanks to some ingenious help from Marjery in engineering, we rigged a system of pulleys across the domed ceiling of the assembly hall. We have an abundance of tough, thin fishing line because of new rules from compliance: in the event of a major disaster, we need to be fully self-sufficient. One of the requirements for self-sufficiency is the ability to source our own food. We decided to bet against societal collapse and are instead going to use the fishing line to lower candles on paper wax catches. We will do this after third bell, as soon as the sun drops behind the ridge line. We should have enough candles to last until eighth bell, so we are prepared for presentations to run late.

The effect of the candlelight hovering underneath the glass dome of the assembly hall will be magical. Isabel talked to Andrew, who handles presentation scheduling. In exchange for telling him about our plans, he agreed to share some of the proceeds from the covert auction that he holds for the best time slots. Whoever presents at third bell is going to get their project approved, no matter what.
