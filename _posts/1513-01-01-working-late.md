## On the effectiveness of topiary

Earlier this year, my manager embarked on a quest to earn a promotion. His success would most likely benefit my own career: I might be offered his current role or a chance to move with him to a new and better position. If neither of those happened, it was still reasonable to assume that his replacement would be at least as competent.

I tried to remind myself of this as I stood in the private garden of our department's vice president, listening to my manager praise the topiary. His success is my success, I thought. Be patient. Remember to smile.

Our entire team was in the garden because my manager had installed an ornamental hedge row in the office. The topiary neatly divided the walkway between our team's two clusters of desks. It was a minor inconvenience for us and a great annoyance for facilities, who had been cajoled into maintaining the hedge. In addition to nearly constant watering, it required regular pruning to maintain the sculpted shape of its original installation.

The hedge was an obvious attempt to earn the attention of the vice president, my manager's direct supervisor. The vice president was known through the office as a botanophile; he spent his annual two-week vacation at a regional coppicing exposition. With the hedge in place, the only question was how to lure the vice president to our floor. His office was in a different building, separated from ours by a moldy side street. Adjacent to the vice president's office was my manager's least favorite peer, a recently hired woman who had quickly become his greatest rival for promotion.

Our first quarterly department meeting of the year was held, unusually, in the only conference room on our floor. When a product that our team was developing came up for discusion, my manager volunteered me to give a demo at my desk. It would have been trivial for me to have prepared a demo for the meeting, had I known in advance.

To my sad surprise, the hedge proved to be the distraction that my manager had hoped for. The demo was forgotten, and our team was invited to tour the vice president's garden later that week. Even the president of the department would make an appearance. Unfortunately for my manager, his rival and her team were also invited.

So that was why we were all (except for the president -- her secretary had come instead) assembled in the garden, listening to my manager's effusive botanical praise. Fortunately, my manager's rival soon cornered the vice president in the solarium. I left as soon as I could, while my manager sulked in the visiting room.

## Work travel

Our office provides its own pigeon rental service for a small fee, which can be expensed for travel. On extended trips, it is possible to rent a large, portable cage with multiple birds; purchases from an approved feed list will also be reimbursed. Unapproved feed is strictly forbidden and can result in the loss of pigeon privileges. We use imported carrier pigeons; they have finicky stomachs. 

I do not need to use the pigeon service on any of my trips. The birds can only be sent directly back to the office, and I have never been in a research or business development role that requires such prompt communication.

In May, I was supposed to run a training session in one of the northern ports, but my manager denied the travel request. I did not mind, since the only local accommodations under the maximum rate were for shared beds. I showed the denial to the team lead on the training project and left her to work it out with my manager.

I did not hear anything else about the training session, but in June, my manager denied another request. This one was an overnight to meet with a remote colleague who had given notice. Some of his responsibilities were being transitioned to me; I needed to work with him to document several of the more arcane processes. I asked my manager if this meant that I was not going to take on the new work. He said no, nothing had changed, and he would expect a status report on the transition at the end of the month.

In July, he cancelled our weekly check-ins. Unfortunately, he had become too busy with a number of important projects.

## Weekly pigeon reports

In August, I received my first pigeon. Because confidential information can be sent by pigeon service, the handling team does not remove the message from a returning pigeon. Instead, they bind the bird's legs and place it on the desk of the recipient, whose name (along with the sender) is supposed to be visible on the outside of the message. 

Because pigeons can also be intercepted on their way to the office, anyone using the pigeon service is required to encode their message with a cipher. The employee handbook is the approved key; in theory, any employee can decode any message, which is why there are strict rules against touching someone else's pigeon.

When my manager got to the office, he asked if I had received his message. He had sent it after tenth bell (not that he expected me to be working that late). Yes, I had received it, and it had pooped on a handout that I had prepared for a meeting that morning. Since I was now running late, I had not yet decoded the message.

I made this reply without looking up from the handout that I was hurrying to re-ink. After some time, I realized that my manager had not moved. I kept working, distracted slightly by his silent presence. Finally, he said, "I do not expect you to work the same hours as myself, but I do expect you to work with some urgency during the hours that you are here."

I stopped inking and looked straight ahead, ignoring him. The only responses I could think of would give him the right of challenge. Duels were forbidden on company premises, but it was not unheard of for one to be postponed until after business hours. There were rumors that dueling was actually a feasible method for obtaining a superior's position, if properly justified. Unfortunately, this would not qualify as sufficient provocation.

After the meeting, I skipped lunch to decode the message. It said, "Update status due end week." I stared at the paper. Weekly updates were always due at the end of the week. I briefly thought about sending my status back to him via pigeon, but that would take hours to write, and I had work to do.

For the next three weeks, I received variations of the same message. The first said, "Reminder weekly update." The second said, "Need status end of week," and the third was, "Important status update." I did not know why he was encoding a new message each time, nor how long it took him to encode each one.

The next week, I returned the pigeon and ignored the message. When he asked about it, as he always did, I said, "I will have my status update for you on Friday." Again, this happened at my desk, with my back turned. Again, he did not move. I tensed and pretended to continue working. My manager remained silent. Finally, I turned, and he said, "I do not waste candles writing messages for you to ignore. We will speak in my office once you have read it."

I skipped my next meeting to decode the message. It said, "Status due Saturday working weekend." I was nearly livid when I entered his office, but I kept my composure as I closed the door and asked, "Why do you need me to work on Saturday?"

"Oh," he replied. "I do not. I will be working during my son's harpsichord recital on Saturday, so I do not need your status report until then."

"I will have it ready for you on Friday, like I always do."

He nodded and resumed reading whatever was on his desk. After several moments of silence, I left his office and went to apologize to the team lead (the same one from the training project) for skipping her meeting.

To my surprise, I received no pigeons during the following week. My manager was also surprised. Each morning, he asked if I had received his message, and each morning I told him, "No, no pigeon today." After Thursday's exchange, I heard his office door slam shut.

## Another department meeting

Each quarterly department meeting has a different agenda; traditionally, the third quarter is reserved for reminders.

<ul class="scripted-dialogue">
<li><span class="speaker">Vice president</span>: Remember to review your travel budgets. Finance says we will be penalized next year for any overages. <em>(Addressing my manager)</em> It looks like your team does not have any remaining budget, so postpone any travel until Q1...</li>
</ul>

<ul class="scripted-dialogue">
<li><span class="speaker">Vice president</span>: Feedback on our new goal-setting process is officially due next week. Anyone have preliminary thoughts?</li>
<li><span class="speaker">My manager</span>: 
Yes, I was reviewing that proposal at my daughter's archery tournament, and I think that...</li>
</ul>

<ul class="scripted-dialogue">
<li><span class="speaker">Vice president</span>: It is never to early to begin gathering feedback for employees you intend to put up for promotion this year...</li>
</ul>

<ul class="scripted-dialogue">
<li><span class="speaker">Vice president</span>: 
The migration project should have wrapped up last month. What is still outstanding?</li>
<li><span class="speaker">The rival</span>: 
Training has not completed. One of the northern ports is still on the old system.</li>
<li><span class="speaker">Me</span>: <em>(Defensively)</em>
I was supposed to...
</li>
<li><span class="speaker">My manager</span>: <em>(Interrupting)</em>
...update the team when you returned from your trip in May. This must just be a reporting error...
</li>
</ul>

I sat next to my manager during the meeting. Afterwards, we left the conference room together. Ahead of us, my manager's rival walked with the vice president, who was saying, "Thanks for the advice about the pigeon shit. I set traps last week and caught a pair each day. They were empty this morning, finally. Whoever sent them must have learned."

"Your garden must have been under a new flight path," said the rival. "What did you do with the birds?"

"Broiled them right away, like you suggested."

"You cooked the messages too?"

"What messages?"

They laughed, and then my manager startled all of us. He grabbed the vice president's shoulder and exclaimed, "That is illegal!"

"What are you talking about?"

"Intercepting pigeons is illegal," he said. This was true. Because of their importance to inter-city communication, pigeons are a protected class.

"And you do not even know whose messages you were intercepting," continued my manager. "They could have been from..." and he lapsed into a pathetic silence, which would have been extremely awkward had I not begun to laugh.

## Understanding

My manager spent our entire travel budget renting pigeons to fly over the vice president's garden, and he had not been properly feeding them. He had anticipated the vice president's irritation at the regular bird shit on his prized topiary. He had even anticipated the confidence that the vice president would take in his rival, as well as the recommendation to quietly trap and dispose of the unwanted birds.

But my manager had not anticipated such recklass disregard for the messages carried by the pigeons. The vice president risked incarceration if he broiled an important pigeon, particularly if it belonged to a large corporation with a competent legal team. No, my manager had expected the vice president to check, to discover that it was he -- he! -- who was hunched over in his kitchen, working ceaselessly by candle to encode important company business.

Perhaps this would lead to a confrontation, if so, all the better. Let it be as public as possible. Let all know who cared more about the company and who cared more about topiary.

I continued to laugh, and the vice president looked back and forth between us. Then without a word, he turned and walked away. Two weeks later, my manager gave notice. I was not offered his position.
